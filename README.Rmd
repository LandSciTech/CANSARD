The CANSARD repository is a home for the development version of CAN-SAR: A database for Canadian species at risk information, tracks changes overtime, and automates the validation process. To access the production version of the database go to the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/e4a58/)

## Description
CAN-SAR: A database for Canadian species at risk information is an initiative led by Dr. Ilona Naujokaitis-Lewis from Environment Climate Change Canada. The aim of this database is to provide open and accessible data reflecting information obtained from Canadian species at risk listing and recovery planning documents. Ongoing efforts include development of a living database that will facilitate contributions from other parties in an effort to increase efficiencies and decrease multiple (redundant) efforts with the broad over-arching goal of improving the conservation of species at risk.
