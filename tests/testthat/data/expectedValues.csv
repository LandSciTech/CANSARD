"34","notes_action_subtype","NA, 1.Protect and enhance existing significant habitat for Allegheny Mountain Dusky Salamanders and Northern Dusky Salamanders in Ontario.
Identify extent of groundwater recharge area. Measure flows of seeps and streams occupied by dusky salamanders to determine seasonal and yearly averages. Have source water protection (both surface and ground water) for land in the upgradient tableland areas. Ensure that all development activities on adjacent land that may involve contaminating or lowering of the groundwater table are monitored for groundwater impacts. Control quantity and quality of stormwater discharge from adjacent land including industrial, recreational and urban areas: eliminate the application of herbicides and pesticides in the vicinity of seeps; monitor stormwater quality for pollutants; develop an emergency spills action plan for the area; create wetland areas to capture and slow down stormwater run-off; plant native trees to stabilize the slope. Monitor erosion rates on the hillsides where salamanders are found for indications of slope instability. Ensure that forest canopy remains intact. Discourage park visitors from off-trail hiking. Investigate and implement best management practices for removal of European Common Reed.
2. Conduct a thorough population study, and if necessary maintain the genetic health of Allegheny Mountain Dusky Salamander and Northern Dusky Salamander populations in Ontario.
Conduct a thorough population study to determine more accurate population size and trends for each species in Ontario: may involve mark-recapture fieldwork and/or genetic analysis.Monitor genetic health of populations: check for inbreeding with genetic analysis every 25 years. If inbreeding appears to be a concern, look into the feasibility of salamander introductions from New York State, which is the nearest population source. Search suitable/accessible habitat in Niagara Gorge for any additional populations of dusky salamanders.
3. Locate additional populations, and expand the current ranges of Allegheny Mountain Dusky Salamanders and Northern Dusky Salamanders through introductions where appropriate.
Research the probability of success if individuals are translocated from sites outside of Ontario to suitable unoccupied habitats: determine likelihood of survival; establish what numbers would be needed for a successful introduction and if they can be moved; research other potential barriers to introductions; identify areas with no obvious impediments to re-establishment; investigate potential habitat along the Niagara Escarpment and Fonthill Kame Morraine.  If potential habitat is found (and successful introduction seems likely), pilot an introduction project.

4. Elicit public support and collaboration in the protection and recovery of Allegheny Mountain Dusky Salamanders and Northern Dusky Salamanders in Ontario.
Prepare educational materials such as pamphlets to inform park visitors about the endangered status of these salamanders and the need to not disturb them or their habitat.
, Survey and monitor status of known and newly discovered populations within the species’ native range. Monitor and maintain planted populations located within the species’ native range in Ontario as potential sources of blight-free native germplasm. Promote protection of known populations of American Chestnut to land management authorities, private landowners and recovery teams, Promote public awareness of American Chestnut.
Investigate the effectiveness of various chestnut blight control measures in an experimental setting, Identify, manage and monitor at least 15 American Chestnut populations of those inventoried within the species’ native range. Develop techniques to decrease species’ vulnerability to chestnut blight, test effects of spreading hypovirulent strains of chestnut blight, conduct an intraspecific and interspecific breeding program for blight resistance in American Chestnut, Restrict inter-jurisdictional movement of all Castanea species in Canada.
Locate and inventory blight-free American Chestnut stands planted in Ontario outside the species’ native range, Monitor and protect at least two blight-free stands planted outside the species’ native range in Ontario
, Main objectives: 1. Protect and manage extant populations and their habitats. 2. Identify and, where necessary, manage threats to populations and habitats. 3. Determine population trends and changes to habitat conditions through regular monitoring. 4. Where feasible and necessary, facilitate recruitment, augment existing populations and consider re-establishing populations at historical sites in suitable habitat. 5. Address knowledge gaps related to population status, management, life history, and severity of threats., Provide legal protection or binding stewardship status to areas of significance for the species implement beneficial management practices (BMP) at the local and landscape levels in order to mitigate threats, with an emphasis on illegal harvest as well as plant and seed mortality, restore habitats and reintroduce the species within historical and extirpated occurrences, Conduct demographic and genetic studies to clarify how American Ginseng populations respond to various threats, study aspects related to the propagation of individuals (e.g., pollinators; ex situ cultivation for transplantation and reintroduction purposes; short and long distance dispersal pathways)
 Establish partnerships with governmental departments and agencies, conservation organizations, Indigenous communities, private landowners and the commercial cultivation industry in order to implement a training/outreach/restoration/reintroduction program, improve the communication and data management for species with sensitive data, promote and verify the compliance with existing environmental laws, regulations and policies to prevent breaches and offenses for all types of activities on all types of land tenures, develop new policies and programs where gaps existhabitats and reintroduce the species within historical and extirpated occurrences, 1.        Develop restoration plans for key colonies: Develop restoration plans for the four suggested administrative areas 
2.        Develop and support programs aimed at reducing threats: Prioritize and implement predator eradication projects at Ancient Murrelet colonies throughout the Canadian breeding range. Ensure that zoning and public land use restrictions currently in place for Ancient Murrelet colonies are actively monitored and enforced. Collaborate with the National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) and the Integrated Satellite Tracking of Polluters (ISTOP) to ensure that oiling deterrence measures and oil hotspot mapping are implemented in areas important to Ancient Murrelet, including Haida Gwaii. Collaborate with appropriate jurisdictions to support and improve existing bycatch reduction measures. This may include: placing at-sea observers on boats, exploring opportunities to introduce electronic monitoring systems, and encouraging the investigation of innovative bycatch reduction techniques.
3.        Undertake research and monitoring : Establish baseline monitoring protocols to assess population size and status at each colony location, Investigate and implement cost-effective introduced predator monitoring techniques to track predator activity and ensure that predators are not re-introduced in restored colonies. Conduct further research on attraction and retention of prospecting adults at vacant breeding colonies using social cues. Expand collaboration, research, and monitoring to address information knowledge gaps regarding location and movement of Ancient Murrelets during the non-breeding season. Conduct further research to assess and monitor the effects of oceanographic changes on colonies other than those currently covered by the Laskeek Bay Conservation Society.
4.        Increase public awareness
, Five strategies constitute the basis of a framework for recovery: research, habitat conservation and protection, mitigation of human activities, promotion of public knowledge and stakeholder participation in the recovery of wolffish populations and the conservation and protection of their habitat, and monitoring of human activities., Monitoring mineral sites is currently believed to be the most effective means of assessing Band-tailed Pigeon trends at the population level. The Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) started identifying mineral sites in British Columbia in 2001 and will continue to do so on an ongoing basis. The Canadian Wildlife Service’s National Harvest Survey (NHS) (which consists of the Harvest Questionnaire Survey and the Species Composition Survey) annually assesses the number of active hunters and the Band-tailed Pigeon harvest. The NHS will continue to be conducted annually to ensure that hunting is kept at a sustainable level. CWS and the B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resources Operations work together to ensure that hunting limits are set to reflect population status and threats. The Canadian Wildlife Service will continue to monitor band returns of birds hunted to determine population trends, demography, and population connectivity. In order to achieve the management objective, conservation measures will be organized under the following three broad strategies:  Population monitoring and surveys, Habitat conservation and stewardship, Research"", 1. Assist with the assessment of the status of the Barn Owl population in Ontario by providing information to the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO) on current distribution, abundance and trends. 2. Increase availability of nest sites. 3. Identify, protect, restore and improve conservation of suitable habitat and its functionality. 4. Develop public awareness and support for Barn Owls and grassland habitat, Recovery objectives: Recovery actions undertaken over the next five years should address the following five objectives towards the achievement of long-term recovery goals:
   I. assess and monitor the status of the natural population
   II. assess range and population dynamics of the natural population
   III. define threats and limiting factors and mitigate controllable
   IV. lessen to the extent possible additional habitat loss and degradation 
  V. implement a stewardship program with local residents and targeted groups
   Approaches to meet recovery objectives: 
   Biological surveys, Habitat protection, Monitoring, Demographic research, Taxonomic research, Ecological research, Public outreach, Compliance to regulations, Genetic research, ex-situ conservation, Restoration, The population and distribution objectives are to restore a naturally reproductive and sustainable eastern population of Barn Owls within suitable climate ranges in Ontario.: 
Stewardship and conservation and Research and inventory : A survey of Batwing Vinyl Lichen populations in B.C. was conducted in 2009 as part of the compilation of the COSEWIC (2011) Assessment and Status Report on this species; three populations known from 1968 and 1975 were searched for, but not found, and are considered to be extirpated. A fourth historical population was found to still exist. Two additional populations were discovered in 2009, ten new populations in 2012/2013 and one new population in 2017. There are likely more populations and more surveys are needed to locate them.
, Monitoring and Research : Conduct taxonomic review of Bent Spike-rush, Southern Mountain population collections at the one known site (east side of Osoyoos Lake) to confirm the species’ correct identification, Conduct targeted surveys in areas of suitable habitat within the proximity of the Bent Spike-rush, Southern Mountain population in the South. Evaluate the effect of water level management on the population and distribution of Bent Spike-rush and other species at risk using similar habitats in the Okanagan Valley. Consult members of the Okanagan Basin Water Board for advice about how this evaluation can complement existing initiatives
Habitat Protection and Stewardship : Continue beneficial alien invasive plant management, Work with respective land managers to develop and implement best management practices for alien invasive plant management, Develop a land use plan for avoiding environmentally sensitive areas and eliminating the threat of future residential development or reducing the threat of recreational disturbance, Consult with respective land managers on how best to provide this support
, Develop and implement standardized protocols for research and monitoring of the species’ population and distribution, their trends, the threats, the species’ ecology as well as the various types of habitat required for its life cycle. Identify the primary migration routes and increase knowledge related to migration chronology
Determine the best measures for promoting conservation and development of each of the three types of breeding habitat as well as the post-breeding habitat, contribute to the conservation, management and, if required, restoration of the habitat used by the species during migration and wintering, promote national and international collaboration to fill the knowledge gaps and address the threats to the species and its habitat throughout its range, promote public involvement in habitat protection and species conservation initiatives as well as in the surveying and monitoring activities

Identify and prioritize sites where mortality, injury and illegal collection of adults are threatening local Blanding’s Turtle populations. Develop or improve, implement, and evaluate mitigation techniques (e.g. best management practices) to address threats to individuals at priority sites.
Identify and prioritize sites where habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation are threatening local Blanding’s Turtle populations, and assess habitat restoration needs. Develop or improve, implement, and evaluate mitigation and habitat restoration techniques to address threats to habitat at priority sites. Conserve areas large enough to maintain viable populations and increase connectivity through administrative and stewardship tools.
Develop and implement communication strategies appropriate to target audiences and to major initiatives to reduce adult mortality, reduce threats and conserve habitat. 
Document recruitment needs at locations where the Blanding’s Turtle is declining or where the viability is deemed to be compromised. Where needed, develop or improve, implement, and evaluate techniques to reduce nest destruction and/or increase recruitment.

4-outreach and education
, Identify and prioritize sites for new habitat creation, enhancement or restoration and, if feasible, restore former habitat at extant and historic sites, adjacent tracts and connecting corridors; Increase municipalities’, businesses’ and landowners’ awareness of habitat protection legislation related to Butler’s Gartersnakes; Develop and encourage alternatives to chemical use (fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides) on agricultural lands that may impact grassland communities ; Develop and implement threat mitigation techniques for other key threats to this species, including subsidized predation, illegal collection and intentional persecution; Implement restoration practices in a strategic manner, including site-specific monitoring; Survey historic, and potential sites using a standard survey protocol and solicit data on occurrences of this species to improve our knowledge of Butler’s Gartersnake distribution in Ontario; Monitor the species for Snake Fungal Disease and determine and implement appropriate mitigation techniques if present; Develop and implement best management practices and provide guidance to private and public landowners, and managers and First Nations on minimizing impacts of activities that threaten the species (e.g., timing of prescribed burns, wetland drainage, pollution), property maintenance (e.g., mowing) and recreational activities; Undertake research (e.g., radio-tracking, mark-recapture) to further determine the habitat necessary for various life stages of Butler’s Gartersnake in Ontario (e.g., hibernation, foraging, etc.) in both natural and restoration areas, particularly in areas with heavily fragmented habitat i.e. Windsor
Portions of the Butler’s Gartersnake subpopulations in this area were formerly found in the corridor being developed for the HGP during pre-construction surveys in 2010 and 2011. After exclusion fencing was erected along the corridor, all snakes found within the fenced construction area were relocated to adjacent habitat on the outside of the fence under a permit issued under the provincial ESA.
, -Specific acts and regulations: guidance for forest management activities and mining and oil and gas exploration and development in the habitat. 
-Parc national de la Gaspésie and other protected areas: hunting has been prohibited in the park since 1949, forestry and mining operations are also prohibited in the park. Since 1978, recreational activities in the park have been managed so as to reduce disturbance of caribou 
-Population monitoring
-Research
-Predator management
-Communication
, identification and delineation of boreal caribou ranges and habitats within ranges; consideration of boreal caribou habitat requirements when planning and implementing forest harvesting and other industrial activities; land-use planning to identify areas within boreal caribou ranges where boreal caribou conservation is prioritized; closed, restricted, and/or managed hunting by Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, on a voluntary basis or through regulations; predator and alternate prey management in some ranges where local populations of boreal caribou are rapidly declining; development of cooperative stewardship agreements and activities to support the engagement of Indigenous organizations and stakeholders in the monitoring, management, and conservation of boreal caribou; preparation of outreach materials on boreal caribou and dissemination to interest groups and the general public; research on boreal caribou ranges, habitat, ecology and limiting factors. Where necessary, apply predator management as an interim management tool, in conjunction with other management approaches (e.g. habitat restoration and management), to achieve boreal caribou local population growth. Alternate prey management may also be applied in conjunction with predator management. Assess and address impacts of hunting regulations for all boreal caribou ranges that overlap with other legally hunted Woodland Caribou ecotypes
Reduce illegal hunting through stewardship, education and enforcement, The recovery planning table identifies approaches that fall under three broad strategies (habitat conservation and management, monitoring and research, and outreach and communication), which together aim to improve the condition of the regional/continental population, increase productivity in Canadian populations and address the causes of high mortality in the non-breeding season., to prevent extirpation of populations in occupied Coastal Tailed Frog watersheds through land use conservation practices that: maintain quality and quantity of stream, riparian, and upland habitats; protect and prevent degradation of specialized aquatic and terrestrial habitats (Prohibition of pesticide use or chemical applications, Prevention of fish introductions and re-channelization of areas with tailed frog populations); and ensure connectivity within and between populations; to address the knowledge gaps in Coastal Tailed Frog ecology that currently constrain the design of management actions; and to address the knowledge gaps in how Coastal Tailed Frog populations respond to threats and management actions (i.e., effectiveness evaluation of conservation management)., Conduct surveys to gather data on presence, abundance, and threats to guide future conservation efforts (Develop and implement a long-term monitoring protocol.). Engage key stakeholders in Crooked-stem Aster conservation and stewardship (Where appropriate, implement BMPs to reduce the impacts of invasive species on Crooked-Stem Aster. Monitor local populations for damage from deer browse. Where necessary implement measures to protect plants from deer browse. Place signage and barriers to control hiker access to populations and to curtail off-trail recreational activities and development of unauthorized trails, promote the use of marked trails only. Support enforcement of unauthorized trails.). Conduct outreach and education to promote awareness of Crooked-stem Aster and its habitats. Address knowledge gaps on the biological and habitat requirements of Crooked-stem Aster, Identify new den (hibernation) sites, secure occupied sites and ensure connectivity is maintained between foraging/migration, shedding and dispersal habitats throughout the species' known range in British Columbia; Reduce road mortality to a level that will not affect population viability; Address knowledge gaps related to population demography, habitat quality, distribution and use and to improve understanding of threats and increase effectiveness of recovery actions. 
Recovery techniques, including habitat protection, habitat restoration and various threat reduction techniques can be used to achieve population and distribution objectives in a reasonable time frame. Habitat securement will require a stewardship approach that engages the voluntary cooperation of landowners and managers on various land tenures to protect this species and the habitat upon which it relies. It may include stewardship agreements, conservation covenants, ecological gifts, voluntary sale of private lands by willing landowners, land use designations, protected areas, management agreements, and existing legislation. Addressing knowledge gaps in relation to distribution and habitat use is important for identifying sites for securement. Clarify potential impacts from livestock; identify mitigation measures, and implement priority actions.
, Objective 1: Adaptively co-manage Dolphin and Union Caribou using a community-based approach.
Objective 2: Communicate and exchange information on an ongoing basis between parties using a collaborative and coordinated approach.
Objective 3: Collect information to fill knowledge gaps on Dolphin and Union Caribou using IQ and TK, community monitoring and scientific methods.
Objective 4: Minimize disturbance to habitat and preserve sea ice crossings to maintain the ability of Dolphin and Union Caribou to move freely across their range. (Proactively work with marine/industry/transportation organizations and regulators to minimize human and industrial disturbance and seek ways to preserve sea ice crossings. Manage populations of other species that affect Dolphin and Union Caribou habitat.)
Objective 5: Ensure management is based on population level so future generations can benefit from sustainable harvesting opportunities. (Manage harvesting activities within acceptable limits using adaptive management techniques included in Section 6, to ensure that harvesting opportunities are available in the future and treaty rights are fully respected. Manage predators using adaptive management techniques included in Section 6 as a natural and necessary part of the ecosystem. )
Harvest management and other management actions should also be informed by the level and trend of the population. This management plan recommends a framework describing how management actions should be adapted at different phases in the Dolphin and Union Caribou cycle, according to when the population is increasing, high, decreasing or low.
There are already some measures in place that assist in managing Dolphin and Union Caribou, including land claim agreements, legislation, regulations, community conservation plans, and land use planning.

, Research and Monitoring; (feasibility of repatriation, population augmentation). Management and Coordination; and Communication and Outreach., Meeting these objectives may involve conserving suitable habitat to allow for colonization and restoring any suitable habitat (upstream or downstream) that is lost or degraded because of human activity, to the extent possible. Species management (species re-introduction and translocation), Awareness raising,  Livelihood, economic and moral incentives (Better products and management practices), Conservation designation and planning (Protected area designation and/or acquisition; Easements and resource rights; Conservation planning), Legal and policy frameworks (ex: Create, amend, or influence laws, regulations and codes regarding the release of air-borne pollutants and water-borne pollutants such that environmental levels do not exceed what cyanolichens can tolerate.), Research and monitoring, Broad Strategy for Recovery: Stewardship and management of the species and its suitable habitat (Support habitat conservation using legal measures (where applicable), stewardship agreements and other regulatory tools on the breeding grounds, along migration routes and on the wintering grounds; Use management techniques over large land units and/or within an ecosystem approach; Restore habitats in some highly modified landscapes to promote the recolonisation of portions of the global distribution range), Monitoring and Research (Develop and implement standardized research and monitoring protocols to gather information on the species’ ecology, populations and trends, habitat characteristics and insect prey populations; Elucidate links between insect populations and migration phenology, especially in the context of climate change ), Education and Partnerships (Promote municipal, provincial, national and international cooperation and coordination of local and landscape-level planning (e.g. Bird Conservation Regions and Conservation Strategies to mitigate threats on the breeding, migrating and wintering ranges), Law and Policy (Encourage the implementation of existing policies and reduction programs for pesticides, light pollution, greenhouse gasses and other pollutants; management of predator populations (where needed) and develop new policies and programs where gaps exist), Eliminate or reduce the main threats to the species and its habitat in Canada (Institute or continue to implement management measures that reduce the likelihood of introgression by the Eastern Coyote or by other large canid species in areas in which the Eastern Wolf occurs; Where necessary and as applicable, establish buffer zones around areas occupied by the Eastern Wolf and develop specific management measures that promote conservation of the species.). Increase the awareness, education and engagement of key stakeholders in Eastern Wolf conservation and promote research initiatives. Conduct surveys, clarify certain demographic parameters and monitor the distribution and population of the Eastern Wolf. Address knowledge gaps that need to be filled to manage the Eastern Wolf (e.g., taxonomy, habitat and threats). More actions:  In 2016, the ban on the harvesting of wolves, Eastern Coyotes and other coyotes was extended to three additional areas. Forest management on public lands in Ontario takes the habitat needs of the Eastern Wolf into account, either directly by restricting logging operations near known dens and rendezvous sites, or indirectly by creating habitat for its prey. the Forest Management Guide for Conserving Biodiversity at the Stand provide information about creating and conserving habitat., The survival and recovery of Enos Lake Stickleback Species Pair is not feasible (see section ‘Recovery Feasibility Summary’) because evidence suggests the Enos Lake Stickleback Species Pair has collapsed into a single hybrid population. Therefore, setting population and distribution objectives for the benthic and limnetic species is not appropriate and no objectives have been set. For information on actions already completed or underway, refer to the Report on the Progress of Recovery Strategy Implementation for the Paxton Lake, Enos Lake, and Vananda Creek Stickleback Species Pairs (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in Canada for the Period 2007 to 2015 (DFO 2016b)., The survival and recovery of Enos Lake Stickleback Species Pair is not feasible (see section ‘Recovery Feasibility Summary’) because evidence suggests the Enos Lake Stickleback Species Pair has collapsed into a single hybrid population.

, Protection and recovery objectives that guide the approaches to recovery are to: develop and implement a coordinated monitoring plan focused on population indices and distribution, habitat stresses and efficacy of recovery actions; conduct research to fill knowledge gaps including ecological studies of habitat; genetic connectivity and the impacts of various threats; describe and map habitat required to meet recovery goals for each of the Ontario populations; protect and manage the habitat of the species and mitigate priority threats; and; improve the delivery and evaluation of stewardship and communications to increase awareness, land stewardship, application of best management practices and citizen science efforts. 
The recovery goal for the Gray Ratsnake in Ontario is to retain the current distribution, population size and connectivity among extant sub-populations within the Frontenac Axis population of eastern Ontario and to achieve self-sustaining sub-populations in the Carolinian population by increasing the distribution and size of the population: Develop and implement a coordinated monitoring plan focused on population indices and distribution, habitat stresses and efficacy of recovery actions; Conduct research to fill knowledge gaps including ecological studies of habitat, genetic connectivity and the impacts of various threats; Describe and map habitat required to meet recovery goals for each of the Ontario populations; Protect and manage the habitat of the species and mitigate priority threats; Improve the delivery and evaluation of stewardship and communications to increase awareness, land stewardship, application of best management practices and citizen science.
, Sufficient information to quantify long-term population and habitat targets is not available for the Gopher Snake. The following objectives are necessary to meet the recovery goal and recover the species : Reduce road mortality to a level that will not affect population viability; Secure denning (hibernation), foraging/migration, egg-laying, and dispersal habitat throughout the species' known range in British Columbia; Address knowledge gaps related to population demography, habitat quality, habitat distribution and use, priority threats, and effectiveness of recovery actions.

Clarify potential impacts from livestock on breeding and terrestrial habitat; identify mitigation measures and implement priority actions.
, The following broad strategies will guide conservation of the Pacific Great Blue Heron in Canada.
Habitat mapping – The location of nesting (woodland) and foraging habitat (eelgrass beds, freshwater and estuarine marshes, grassy habitats, ditches, and riversides) needs to be mapped to support its conservation by responsible jurisdictions and landowners. Mapping also needs to be done to identify habitat that should be set aside for future nesting (alternate habitat is required because Pacific Great Blue Heron colonies move locations from time to time).
Habitat conservation – Those habitats considered necessary for conservation of the species, including existing and alternate habitat, need to be conserved. Since many Pacific Great Blue Heron colonies are on private land, a program of incentives (such as Natural Areas Protection Tax Exemption Program and Ecological Gifts Program) could provide landowners with the impetus to protect nesting trees and buffers. Land stewardship agreements and both provincial and federal protection should be pursued for nesting and foraging grounds (e.g., via mechanisms such as Wildlife Habitat Areas and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs).
Habitat stewardship and education – Outreach with individual landowners (to inform them of the species’ needs and encourage them to adjust landscaping and other activities) is needed to reduce disturbance and habitat loss for birds that nest on/adjacent to private land. Interpretive signage and community meetings also will build awareness of the negative effects of human recreation on foraging Pacific Great Blue Herons.
Research and monitoring to fill knowledge gaps – The current monitoring program must be continued and enhancements made to ensure that reliable population estimates can be generated and appropriate management targets established for all Conservation Regions. Research is required to assess potential methods for mitigation of threats from human disturbance and Bald Eagle predation (CDC 2014), as well as the importance of emerging industrial contaminants (such as PBDEs; COSEWIC 2008). The threat from Bald Eagle predation is not well understood currently, so, until further research is conducted, it is not clear what appropriate mitigation options (if any) can be employed. Population modeling is required to better understand the metapopulation dynamics between Haida Gwaii, Mainland Coast, Vancouver Island, and Lower Fraser River Valley and the numbers required for viability in each of these Conservation Regions. Juvenile herons from wildlife rescues might be able to increase recruitment in some populations; however, more research into this technique is required. Attaching radio or satellite tags onto rehabilitated juveniles could provide valuable information about heron movement patterns.
Habitat restoration – The restoration of marine (e.g., eelgrass enhancement, spartina removal) and upland (e.g., planting old field and grassy cover that promote small mammal populations) foraging habitats in the more heavily-developed areas of the coast (especially in the Lower Fraser River Valley), as well as selected habitats by planting alders or other beneficial vegetation, will help to ensure that priority nesting and foraging locations remain as functional as possible. This may help to reduce the risk of colonies frequently relocating and provide mature trees for nesting in the future., To work towards achieving the population and distribution objectives, six broad strategies for recovery have been established, and are outlined in Table 2. The broad strategies are: communication and outreach; surveys and monitoring; habitat stewardship and conservation (Develop and/or contribute to stewardship information for private landowners on Pelee Island to encourage maintenance/restoration of forested habitat.); research; protection and management; law and policy (Promote compliance with existing laws, regulations and policies to prevent breaches and offenses detrimental to Grey Foxes, for all types of activities on all types of land tenures), In order to achieve the management objective, conservation measures will be organized under four broad strategies: inventory and monitoring; research as part of an adaptive management framework; communication, collaboration and engagement; habitat assessment, management and conservation, 1.1. Develop and implement a research program on the life cycle (reproduction, birth, moult, etc.) and on species behaviour over time. 1.2. Compile traditional knowledge of the seal’s ecology and behaviour. 1.3. Improve knowledge about seal predators. 2.1. Evaluate the genetic variability and isolation of the seal population. 2.2. Develop a survey method adequate for each population segment. 2.3. Compile traditional ecological knowledge in order to estimate population size. 2.4. Survey seal population with the help of local communities and the Kativik Regional Government via the Tursujuq National Park. 3.1. Implement appropriate protection measures and zoning within Tursujuq National Park. 3.2. Consider possible protective measures for potential seal habitat outside the park boundaries.  4.1. Provide the communities with the means (sampling program, questionnaires, etc.) to track and evaluate the harvest. 4.2. Raise awareness of the hunters concerned to ensure good communication and facilitate good data collection. 4.3. Evaluate the possibility of introducing other conservation measures in collaboration with local communities. 5.1. Study the behaviour of the seals when faced with anthropogenic disturbance at different moments in their life cycle. 5.2. Encourage the Tursujuq National Park’s authorities to implement new management measures or modify existing ones to reduce disturbances due to tourism. 5.3. Encourage the Tursujuq National Park’s authorities to inform, and increase the awareness of, visitors about the seal and its habitat to encourage them to take appropriate precautions in the areas the seal is known to inhabit. 6.1. Identify partners and target clientele. 6.2. Secure the participation and collaboration of the Cree and Inuit. 6.3. Develop the educational tools to inform people about the seal and the threats it faces, while minimizing disturbance. 6.4. Involve local communities in collecting information on the population. 7.1. Evaluate increases in predators such as the black bear. 7.2. Assess seal habitat alterations caused by climate change. 7.3. Assess the impact of climate change on diseases and parasites. 8.1. Ensure that freshwater seals are considered in environmental impact assessments of mining projects. ” Hunting on park territory by park visitors remains prohibited, and aboriginal hunting rights as delineated in the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement are maintained., The recovery objectives outlined to achieve this goal are as follows: protect and maintain the quantity and quality of Hine's Emerald habitat and habitat functionality, including the hydrological and hydrogeological function (Where feasible, restore altered hydrological and/or hydrogeological regimes); reduce or mitigate threats to Hine's Emerald and its habitat (Monitor and mitigate invasive species in and around Hine's Emerald habitat); increase knowledge of Hine's Emerald biology in Ontario including distribution, abundance, life history and habitat needs; and increase public awareness and understanding of Hine's Emerald and its habitat in Ontario, Maintaining the existing local populations of the Hungerford's Crawling Water Beetle in Canada will require protection and management, including the identification of threats at a watershed scale, and the mitigation or removal of threats to the species, especially those related to water quality and water level management. Recovery efforts focus on working with partners and landowners to implement best management practices within watersheds, promoting the maintenance of healthy aquatic ecosystems, and conducting surveys to improve knowledge on the distribution and abundance of the species. The impacts of some potential threats to this species, such as changes in water chemistry due to agricultural run-off, are not well understood because of a lack of knowledge of the species' biology and ecology, including the role of natural and human-made water control structures in providing habitat for Hungerford's Crawling Water Beetle. Addressing such knowledge gaps will be an important part of achieving the population and distribution objectives. Confirmation of the specific habitat requirements of Hungerford's Crawling Water Beetle, including the distribution and role of the larval food plant (i.e., D. tuberosus), water quality and flow requirements, tolerance to sediment loads, habitat for reproduction and hibernation, and dispersal ability may also be important to achieving the population and distribution objectives. Provided that other threats to stream habitat (e.g., reduction of water quality) are managed and mitigated, stable or increasing local populations would be expected to persist within the species' current range.
The recovery goal is to enhance long-term population viability by maintaining at least three self-sustaining populations of Hungerford’s Crawling Water Beetle in Ontario. This should be achieved by actively protecting and managing suitable habitat for this species and its ecosystem in southern Ontario. Protection and recovery objectives are as follows. Protect existing populations and habitat where Hungerford’s Crawling Water Beetle is found; Determine the distribution and abundance of Hungerford’s Crawling Water Beetle outside the existing known sites; Investigate the habitat requirements of the species and in particular determine the role of human-made impoundments; Identify, quantify and seek to mitigate or remove threats to existing populations; Promote ongoing measures to protect vegetation adjacent to the extant occurrences of Hungerford’s Crawling Water Beetle and watershed vegetation cover; Investigate the possibility of translocation from a thriving population to the North Saugeen population, if required; 
, 1. Identify and protect populations and their habitats by working collaboratively with landowners and land managers. (Promote the use of Species at Risk stewardship funding, Land Stewardship and Habitat Restoration Program, Conservation Land Tax Incentive Program tax incentives, Ecogifts program, and other funding programs within the agricultural community to support protection and stewardship activities)
2. Regularly monitor and report on all populations and habitats.
3	Address knowledge gaps relating to the ecology and management of Juniper Sedge. (Conduct experimental research on the effects of habitat management activities (e.g. grazing treatments, canopy thinning, invasive species control) on alvar woodland habitat, and/or Juniper Sedge populations.)
4	Identify and manage threats through monitoring and management of Juniper Sedge populations and habitat. (Determine and, if necessary, control the threat of invasive species (especially European Buckthorn) as required: with land owners or land managers, assess the threat of invasive species at each site and prioritize control; conduct control and restoration efforts in priority order.)
5	If feasible and necessary, consider ex-situ conservation of Juniper Sedge through germplasm conservation ( If necessary, consider ex-situ conservation techniques such as: preserving Juniper Sedge germplasm (seed storage) from Ontario populations in a recognized storage facility; population augmentation; plant propagation)
, General Description of Research and Management Approaches: Prioritize historical sites for restoration based on capacity to support metapopulation; Develop and implement site-specific restoration and management plans for historical Karner Blue sites to maintain and expand suitable habitat; Building on the existing St. Williams Conservation Reserve Management Plan, develop species-specific restoration and management goals for Frosted Elfin; Create or restore dispersal habitat to connect suitable habitat; Where possible and appropriate, secure additional land adjacent to historically known habitat to increase habitat available for habitat restoration and/or creation and to allow for expansion of existing historic locations in order to meet the medium-term population and distribution objective; Identify additional sites which provide habitat for Frosted Elfin and Karner Blue, and develop and implement site-specific management and restoration plans including: Restoration/management plans which allow for reintroduction at additional non-historic locations where suitable habitat is already being restored for the purpose of recovery; Restore additional habitat areas to meet long term population and distribution objective through known restoration techniques (e.g., controlled burns, vegetation clearing, and planting of Wild Lupines); Control excessive Wild Lupine browsing
Conduct research on the following:
Karner Blue
efficient Wild Lupine seed germination and requirements for maintenance of large populations; implications of the exotic European Fire Ant to Karner Blue; further understanding of the minimum viable population size necessary to fully recover Karner Blue at potential reintroduction site(s); abundance and diversity of larval tending ant species associated with potential reintroduction sites; emergence timing, Wild Lupine/nectar plant availability, and weather-linked changes in Karner Blue activity at potential reintroduction sites; extent of interspecific competition for food resources during caterpillar life stage; Wild Lupine abundance and habitat suitability at sites not recently studied by Jarvis (2014) such as Ojibway Prairie, Windsor, and Walpole Island
Develop and deliver stewardship initiatives to protect suitable habitat; Work collaboratively with stakeholders including landowners, conservation authorities, municipalities, government and non-government organizations, and First Nations to protect and manage suitable habitat; Develop and implement Best Management Practices for Karner Blue and Frosted Elfin suitable habitat; Develop and implement site-specific invasive species management plans according to Best Management Practices for Karner Blue and Frosted Elfin; Monitor the success of habitat restoration and management activities (e.g., whether sufficient suitable habitat has been restored/ managed to support a metapopulation of Karner Blue and/or Frosted Elfin). Monitor the status of threats, such as invasive species, larval foodplant defoliation, pesticide/herbicide drift unauthorized collection, and off-road vehicle use in suitable habitat. Engage landowners, land managers and First Nations in discussions about Karner Blue and Frosted Elfin, in the importance of recovery, threats, and techniques to recover the species and their habitats; Encourage the planting of Wild Lupine and appropriate native nectaring flowers by local landowners; If reintroduction is determined to be necessary and biologically and technically feasible: Develop communication strategies for the reintroduction of Karner Blue and Frosted Elfin; Develop a training program for wildlife enforcement officers to educate them on the location of potential reintroduction sites and the identification of the species
, Narrative to support conservation measures and implementation schedule
 In order to apply appropriate conservation measures, it is important to more accurately determine the current population of the Lake Erie Watersnake in Canada. The most recent Canadian surveys took place more than ten years ago, and it is unknown if increased consumption of Round Goby by the subspecies has had the same beneficial effects on the Canadian population as it has for the United States population. Once current population estimates are established, the necessary monitoring protocols can be implemented in order to identify population and distribution trends and address threats as needed. A collaborative, stewardship first approach that partners with the municipality, the provincial and federal governments, and local partners is intended to meet both the needs of the community and species that contribute to Pelee Island's biodiversity, such as Lake Erie Watersnake.

Knowledge gaps relating to the impact, scope, severity and timing of certain threats, including road mortality, and shoreline habitat loss, impacts resulting from changes in island bird populations (i.e., Double-crested Cormorants, and Wild Turkeys) and the potential impact of SFD need to be addressed. The community of Pelee Island celebrates their natural history and significant efforts have been made to address primary threats of habitat loss as well as accidental or intentional mortality, through collaborative conservation efforts and information exchange, and through improved signage and road speed reduction. Continuing efforts that foster community-based conservation initiatives and promote habitat stewardship and threat mitigation remain very important components to protect the biodiversity of the island, including the Lake Erie Watersnake., inventory and monitoring : Conduct further surveys within the historical distribution range of Lilliput to detect remnant populations. Determine extent and abundance of any newly discovered remnant populations detected. Establish stations to monitor changes to Lilliput habitat. This monitoring will inform threat level assessments regarding impacts to populations and will complement and be integrated into routine population surveys. It will also allow for the evaluation of progress achieved through recovery implementation activities to reduce threats. Monitor the distribution and abundance of Zebra Mussel within currently occupied habitats (for example, critical habitat areas). Quantify infestation rates for live mussels that are present and determine upstream limit of Zebra Mussel within Lilliput-bearing systems. Deliver outreach sessions on species at risk mussels, their critical habitat, and the threats facing them. The Hamilton Harbour Remedial Action Plan is a project planned to improve water quality and habitat in the Hamilton Harbour watershed and Cootes Paradise Marsh. Examples of some of the activities that have occurred as part of the plan include Common Carp exclusion from Cootes Paradise, as well as extensive fish and habitat monitoring. The objective of the plan is to clean up Hamilton Harbour and to improve the health of the ecosystem.
Research : Identify thresholds of tolerance to habitat modifications (for example, fluctuations in water levels) to aid in determining what constitutes destruction of Lilliput critical habitat. ,Determine glochidia and juvenile sensitivity to environmental contaminants that populations of Lilliput may be exposed to, particularly those contaminants found in the sediment. Determine the life history of the Lilliput (for example, age at maturation) to inform critical habitat identification and improve modelling efforts designed to determine quantifiable recovery targets. Determine the feasibility of augmenting existing populations of Lilliput where needed, and investigate the feasibility re-establishing Lilliput into historical habitat where appropriate. Develop genetically sound propagation guidelines for freshwater mussels.
stewardship and outreach: Implement local stewardship programs to improve habitat conditions and reduce threats within critical habitat and historical habitats. Priorities and mitigation approaches to be informed through threat evaluation research. Address watershed-scale stressors to Lilliput populations and their habitat in cooperation with existing relevant aquatic ecosystem recovery teams. Increase public awareness of the potential impacts of transporting and releasing invasive species (including baitfish). Encourage public support and participation in mussel recovery by developing awareness materials and programs, which in turn will encourage participation in local stewardship programs to improve and protect Lilliput habitat.
, Implement standardized protocols and survey / monitoring designs for the three species of bats and their habitats across Canada (e.g., using North American Bat Monitoring Program), Maintain an effective and coordinated white-nose syndrome (WNS) surveillance program across Canada, Monitor trends in bat prey across their Canadian ranges
Investigate techniques to prevent or reduce the spread, mitigate the effects of, and/or treat WNS, Identify risk factors that may exacerbate the spread of WNS, Determine if natural, genetic resistance occurs within the remnant populations; Further investigate likely pathways of introduction and identify locations most at risk of WNS; Continue to investigate best techniques to reduce disturbance (e.g., gate design) while alleviating landowner safety concerns; Determine the effectiveness of bat house designs across Canada and their value for conservation and recovery; Continue to investigate the diet composition using advanced techniques (e.g., DNA sequencing) throughout their annual cycles and their ranges; Deliver outreach products to key interest groups (e.g., landowners, cavers, industrial sectors, nuisance wildlife control organizations, and wildlife rehabilitators), Aboriginal peoples, and the general public on the importance of maintaining hibernacula and maternity roosts (including the approaches to do so) and the consequences of WNS; Develop targeted threat mitigation outreach products (e.g., decontamination protocols) and actively promote them to relevant stakeholders; Communicate the importance of bats to people, ecosystems, biodiversity, and economies; Encourage landowners and industrial sector stakeholders, such as wind energy and mining, to develop, implement, and promote beneficial management practices to mitigate threats to the species’ and their habitats where they are known to occur (e.g., related to nuisance wildlife control, wind energy, mining, forestry, agriculture, and gate design); Mitigate sources of mortality that may have additional detrimental impacts on bat populations (beyond that caused by WNS); Conserve and enhance habitat for the species and their prey throughout their Canadian distributions (with particular attention to natural habitat); Should treatments, mitigative measures, or measures to prevent or reduce the spread of WNS become available, establish methods and implement techniques, Participate in initiatives aimed at reducing climate change, mercury contamination, pesticide use, and other toxic substances; If deemed appropriate, increase available habitat (foraging and roosting) in strategic locations and promote activities that may increase population growth (e.g., reduce mortality of individuals in the first year); Develop, implement, and promote compliance with federal (e.g., SARA), provincial, and municipal acts and policies related to reducing threats and encouraging conservation of these species, their prey, and their habitat; Consider the species’ requirements in management plans and policies for public lands, environmental assessments, and land-use (energy, forestry, mining, agriculture, etc.) planning initiatives
, 1. Research and monitor Loggerhead Sea Turtle abundance, distribution, and movements, including as they relate to critical habitat identification (see table 6); 2. Quantify the threat of fisheries-related harm and mortality to Loggerhead Sea Turtles; 3. Evaluate bycatch and entanglement prevention and mitigation methods, current and proposed; 4. Refine understanding of other non-fishery threats to Loggerhead Sea Turtles; 5. Ensure the protection and recovery of the Loggerhead Sea Turtle is considered in the management of all relevant ocean activities; 6. Continue and adapt threat mitigation measures as new information becomes available (that is, keep current with global best practices); 7. Establish threat impact thresholds for Loggerhead Sea Turtles; 8. Work collaboratively with ocean users to develop and adopt effective threat mitigation measures for Loggerhead Sea Turtles; 9. Continue and expand educational outreach to ocean users regarding Loggerhead Sea Turtles and their threats; 10. Continue sharing data with international bodies such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), and explore new opportunities to collaborate with other international bodies (for example, NAFO); 11. Continue and develop new research partnerships with collaborators throughout the population’s range; 12. Explore opportunities for collaboration through the Inter-American Convention (IAC) for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles and other relevant international agreements or conventions, The threats of livestock grazing, encroachment of invasive species and of natural forest succession due to fire suppression need to be monitored periodically to determine the effects on the populations over the longer term. Thus the management objectives are: assess and mitigate livestock impacts at 3 known Lyall's Mariposa Lily populations and 2 of the known subpopulations during critical phenological periods; assess and mitigate the threats of invasive alien species encroachment, and forest encroachment (secondary succession) due to fire suppression ; monitor all known Lyall's Mariposa Lily populations every 3 to 5 years, This recovery strategy concludes that recovery for the Macropis Cuckoo Bee is not feasible at this time. The recovery strategy does not include population and distribution objectives or a recovery planning table and critical habitat cannot be identified at this time. As such, there is no risk for the implementation of this strategy to inadvertently lead to adverse effects on other species.A priority for research is to locate viable population of Macropis Cuckoo Bee in association with Macropis nest sites. Surveys for Lysimachia and Macropis in suitable habitat in Nova Scotia, and the northern Great Plains and adjacent areas (for example, southcentral Canada from western Ontario to Alberta) would be particularly worthwhile.
The Alberta specimen was collected in Elk Island National Park. Elk Island National Park protects a representative portion of the Southern Boreal Plains and Plateaux Natural Region. If Macropis Cuckoo Bee (with associated Macropis ) is confirmed in Elk Island National Park, the National Parks Act will benefit the Macropis Cuckoo Bee, its host bees (Macropis ), and its Lysimachia habitat.

The Nova Scotia Wetland Conservation Policy may provide for the conservation and management of wetlands in Nova Scotia. If Macropis Cuckoo Bees are present in Nova Scotia, the Nova Scotia Wetland Conservation Policy and the promotion of wetland stewardship may benefit the Macropis Cuckoo Bee, its Macropis hosts, and its Lysimachia habitat.

The determination of recovery feasibility will be re-evaluated in response to changing conditions and/or knowledge (that is, if viable populations of Macropis Cuckoo Bees are observed during inventories)., Three broad strategies were recommended to address threats to the species and habitat as well as to meet the population and distribution objectives: 1) Research and Monitoring; 2) Management and Coordination; and, 3) Communication and Outreach.The overall success of implementing the recommended recovery approaches will be evaluated primarily through routine population (distribution and abundance) and habitat (quality and quantity) surveys and monitoring (refer to implementation schedule – table 5, recovery measures #1 and #4).  During the next five years, focus will be placed on completing recovery actions identified as “high priority” for Mapleleaf.  Reporting on implementation of the action plan components, under s. 55 of SARA, will be done by assessing progress towards achieving the broad strategies/approaches outlined in this document.  Reporting on the ecological and socio-economic impacts of the action plan, under s. 55 of SARA, will be done by assessing the results of monitoring the recovery of the species and its long term viability, and by assessing the implementation of the action plan., Determine the current distribution of key aquatic exotic, invasive or introduced species on Vancouver Island (Develop a Rapid Response Plan to implement in case an aquatic exotic/invasive/introduced species is found in Misty Lake). Develop and implement a Total Prevention Plan for aquatic invasive species. Address information gaps that inhibit conservation of the Misty Lake Sticklebacks and their critical habitat. Increase scientific understanding of the Misty Lake Sticklebacks through additional investigation into their natural history and threats to their persistence. Continue to develop sound protocols for scientific investigations (Set boundaries for experimental work and collection activities in an effort to reduce harm to the species). Manage and protect the habitat of the Misty Lake Sticklebacks. Increase understanding of population trends and make linkages to threats. Continue to develop and implement a long term monitoring program to assess population response to management activities and/or threats. Develop and implement educational outreach materials to foster awareness of the species and encourage active local involvement in stewardship and habitat protection. 
Misty Lake Ecological Reserve was established in 1996 under the Protected Areas of British Columbia Act, with the primary intent of protecting sticklebacks in the lake. The reserve was increased from 55 ha to 68 ha in 2001, which represents the area of the lake itself and a strip of land around it. Misty Lake and short sections of the inlet and outlet streams are contained within the Misty Lake Ecological Reserve (COSEWIC 2006). The entire reserve affords protection from consumptive uses that include hunting, fishing, and camping. Since the creation of the Misty Lake Ecological Reserve, the sticklebacks have been protected from capture or retention within the reserve’s boundaries, except when authorized by permit.
, The management objective establishes, to the extent possible, the number of individuals and/or populations, and their geographic distribution, that are necessary to prevent the species from becoming endangered or threatened, or to allow for the removal of the species from schedule 1 of SARA. Management objectives are ideally stated as quantitative targets (for example, for population abundance or habitat quantity and quality). Insufficient information is available about current population abundance to develop scientifically defensible quantitative targets for the Mountain Sucker, Pacific populations. Therefore, the management objective for Mountain Sucker, Pacific populations, is to maintain self-sustaining populations throughout their current distribution to ensure the species’ long-term viability in the wild.
The following broad strategies support the management objective outlined in section 6. Broad strategies and measures for the conservation of the species are summarized and prioritized in tables 2 to 4: inventory and monitoring; research; management and coordination; stewardship and outreach
, The provincial recovery plan outlines actions already completed or currently underway for Soapweed and the Yucca Moth (Part 2: Recent Recovery and Conservation Efforts). Additional actions completed or underway for the Non-pollinating Yucca Moth and the Five-spotted Bogus Yucca Moth include:
Soapweed plants at the Onefour site were monitored to estimate Non-pollinating Yucca Moth abundance from 1999 to 2003 (Hurlburt 2004); in 2002 - 2003, Soapweed plants at the Onefour site were monitored for the presence of Non-pollinating Yucca Moth and Five-spotted Bogus Yucca Moth (Snell 2004; Snell and Addicott 2008 a,b); Yucca Moth, Non-pollinating Yucca Moths and Five-spotted Bogus Yucca moths were counted at the Onefour site during a week-long visit in 2007 (Hurlburt 2007); an inventory of the Non-pollinating Yucca Moth and the Five-spotted Bogus Yucca Moth population was undertaken at the Pinhorn site in 2004 to determine the size of the population and level of larval emergence (Foreman et al. 2006); completion of an inventory of the Non-pollinating Yucca Moth and Five-spotted Bogus Yucca Moth populations at the Onefour and Pinhorn sites by an independent biological consultant in 2011 for the updated COSEWIC status report for both species (see Hurlburt 2011, COSEWIC 2013a); additional exclosures at the Pinhorn site to protect Soapweed plants form wild ungulate herbivory will be installed in spring 2017 (S. Robertson pers. comm. 2016) 
, Monitor recovery of Nooksack Dace; Fill knowledge gaps that inhibit the recovery of Nooksack Dace; Ensure the integrity and proper function and reduce the fragmentation of riparian areas throughout watersheds; Protect existing habitat, restore lost or degraded habitat and create new habitat; Establish and maintain adequate baseflow in all habitats with high potential productivity; Reduce sediment entry to instream habitats; Minimize entry of harmful substances to instream habitats; Reduce fragmentation of instream habitats; Encourage stewardship amongst private landowners, local governments and the general public; Explore opportunities for coordinating population assessment and recovery efforts with interested groups in United States, The approaches above focus on conserving and, where feasible, increasing, the distribution and abundance of the extant population on Walpole Island First Nation and re-introducing native Northern Bobwhites to the mainland. Activities also highlight the need for habitat restoration. Various stakeholders will  need to be engaged including private and public landowners, land users, planners, non-government and government organizations. Partnerships will need to be developed with willing landowners and conservation groups particularly when considering re-introduction on the mainland. Habitat protection, management and restoration are of the utmost importance to recover Northern Bobwhite, as habitat loss and fragmentation have been the most significant threats to the species. On-going implementation of best management practices to control European Common Reed and other invasive plant species will be needed. Assessing habitat for interspersion of key habitat types and ensuring sufficient quantity and connectivity of habitat, particularly of winter habitat, will be required to guide habitat restoration on Walpole Island First Nation and the mainland. Threat mitigation will be necessary to reduce predation and other causes of mortality and encourage population growth of the remaining population on Walpole Island First Nation and eventually, if feasible, a re-introduced population on the mainland. Outreach and education will be needed to reduce exposure to herbicides and insecticides and encourage ecologically appropriate use of fire on Walpole Island First Nation. Further restriction of game bird hunting preserves on the mainland will need to be considered as locations for habitat restoration and re-introduction are identified and prioritized. Collaboration with agencies and organizations involved in Northern Bobwhite research in the United States will be important to use lessons-learned  from the extensive amount of work completed and underway south of the border. Where technically feasible, further genetic analysis in the form of a monitoring program could provide more insight into the genetic diversity of Northern Bobwhites on Walpole Island First Nation and if necessary birds on the mainland, and also help understand future patterns of population expansion, dispersal behaviour, habitat use and identification of potential sink habitats (Miller et al. 1999; Frankham et al. 2002 in Chabot 2014). It could also help evaluate the need for and scope of a captive breeding and release program, if deemed appropriate and feasible. As a potential threat European Fire Ant presence and impact on Northern Bobwhite will need to be monitored., The following short-term objectives have been identified to assist in meeting this goal over a five-year period:
to conserve and protect extant populations; to refine understanding of population and habitat trends; to identify, mitigate and monitor threats impacting the species’ survival and conservation; to maintain, enhance, and where feasible, restore habitat to support Northern Brook Lamprey; to address knowledge gaps and broaden knowledge of the species’ biology and ecology to enable and enhance management efforts; to improve the efficiency of conservation efforts through coordinated actions with other aquatic ecosystem recovery teams and other complementary conservation groups and/or initiatives; to increase public awareness about the importance of biodiversity and healthy aquatic ecosystems, particularly amongst various partners, First Nations, interest groups, organizations and landowners interested in supporting the conservation efforts for Northern Brook Lamprey, Objective 1: To manage and, where necessary, conserve and recover habitat that meets the needs of Northern Goshawk A. gentilis laingi through its annual cycle.
Objective 2: To conserve and, where necessary, recover a well-distributed and viable population of Northern Goshawk A. gentilis laingi within coastal B.C.
These objectives are broad at this time because the recovery team lacks basic information on the amount of suitable habitat available historically, relative to current supply and predicted future supplies (under different management scenarios), as well as population responses to habitat supply over time. Therefore, the recovery team has outlined a number of activities and associated timelines, which will help close these information gaps at which time the recovery objectives can be refined and updated.
Approach / Strategy : Discover or manage habitat for additional home ranges to meet population and distribution objectives.; Develop approaches to mitigate human induced mortality.; Genetic analysis.; Refine population and distribution objectives.; Refine Steventon (2012 a,b) Population Viability Analysis (PVA).
, The broad strategies of this management plan are as follows: use legislative and administrative tools to conserve Northern Map Turtle individuals and habitat; reduce individual (adult and hatchling) mortality, injury and illegal collection across the range of the Northern Map Turtle in Canada; conserve, manage and restore habitat across the range of the Northern Map Turtle in Canada; conduct communication and outreach to promote efficient and collaborative management efforts across the range of Northern Map Turtle in Canada; survey and monitor Northern Map Turtle local populations, habitats and threats to provide baseline information and to monitor population trends and habitat use; conduct research on population demographics, habitat characterization and use, and threats/threat mitigation to fill knowledge gaps
1.1 Continue to promote compliance with existing provincial and federal legislation applicable to Northern Map Turtle individuals and their habitat.; 1.3  Continue to encourage stewardship activities, including financial support through available funding programs.; 2.1 Continue to develop and encourage implementation of mitigation techniques (e.g., (BMPs) and alternatives to traditional development) to reduce individual mortality and injury, illegal collection, and exotic and invasive species. Examples of priority mitigations measures include: Implement and evaluate techniques to reduce boating injury and mortality on areas with high to moderate boat traffic (e.g., cottage area) and to reduce turtle by-catch in commercial and  recreational fisheries.; •Implement and evaluate techniques to control predator populations or restrain access to nesting habitats through direct and indirect measures (e.g., garbage removal, predator management, fencing).;. Conserve areas large enough to support habitat needs of local populations and increase connectivity by stewardship, development, promotion and implementation of BMPs and/or land conservation.; 3.2 Prevent the establishment and control the spread of exotic and invasive species, and control or eliminate such species where they are detrimental to Northern Map Turtle local populations.; 3.3 Assess habitat restoration needs at locations where habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation are threatening Northern Map Turtle local populations.; support local populations.; 4.2 Develop and implement a communication and outreach strategy or continue implementing existing communication and outreach tools to help address threats to the species.; 5.1 Identify nesting sites and overwintering sites of local populations for which information is not available or incomplete.; 5.3 Develop, and promote the appropriate use of standardized protocols for survey, monitoring and data bases (e.g., data collection, handling, marking).; 5.4 Monitor local populations, habitat trends and threats to the species.
, Objective 1 strategies :Determine the seasonal and annual diet and energetic requirements of Resident Killer Whales; Identify key prey populations and feeding areas for Resident Killer Whales; Establish long-term monitoring programs capable of detecting changes in the abundance, distribution and quality of Resident Killer Whale prey; Protect the access of Resident Killer Whales to important feeding areas; Ensure that Resident Killer Whale prey populations and their (the prey’s) habitat are adequately protected from anthropogenic factors such as exploitation and degradation, including contamination, which will allow for the recovery of Resident Killer Whales
Objective 2 strategies: Investigate the effects of chemical and biological pollutants on the health and reproductive capacity of Resident Killer Whales; Monitor chemical and biological pollutant levels in Resident Killer Whales and their prey; Identify (and prioritize) key chemical and biological contaminants and their sources; Reduce the introduction into the environment of pesticides and other chemical compounds that have the potential to adversely affect the health of Killer Whales and/or their prey, through measures such as national and international agreements, education, regulation, and enforcement; Mitigate the impacts of currently and historically used ‘legacy’ pollutants in the environment; Investigate diseases, pathogens, parasites, and pathologies of Killer Whales; Reduce the introduction of biological pollutants, including pathogens and exotic species, into the habitats of Killer Whales and their prey
Objective 3 strategies: Determine the short and long-term effects of chronic and immediate forms of disturbance, including vessels and noise, on the physiology, foraging, and social behaviour of Resident Killer Whales; Determine baseline ambient and anthropogenic noise profiles and monitor sources and changes in the exposure of Resident Killer Whales to underwater noise; Develop and implement regulations, guidelines, sanctuaries and other measures to reduce or eliminate physical and acoustic disturbance of Resident Killer Whales; Develop protocols, regulations, guidelines and/or other measures for the use of underwater seismic survey tools and high energy sonar testing, as most appropriate and in collaboration with stakeholders, to reduce disturbance or injury to Resident Killer Whales, where such activities are permitted
Objective 4 strategies :Develop a year-round comprehensive survey program for Resident Killer Whales; Identify key feeding areas and other critical habitat of Resident Killer Whales throughout the year; Protect the access of Resident Killer Whales to their critical habitat; Protect critical habitat areas through assessment and mitigation of human activities that result in contamination and physical disturbance; Ensure that sufficient prey is available to Killer Whales in their critical habitat.; Ensure trans-boundary cooperation in the identification and protection of critical habitat
, Recovery objectives: The 5-year recovery objectives are to: determine extent, abundance and population demographics of existing populations; determine host fishes and their distributions and abundances; define key habitat requirements to identify critical habitat; establish a long-term monitoring program for all species, their hosts and the habitats; confirm/identify threats, evaluate their relative importance and implement remedial actions to minimize their impacts; examine the feasibility of relocations, reintroductions and the establishment of managed refuge sites; increase awareness about the distribution, threats and recovery of these species
2.4 Approaches to meeting recovery objectives: The approaches to recovery have been organized into four broad strategies: research and monitoring (table 2), management (table 3), stewardship (table 4), and awareness (table 5). Successful recovery will require consideration of approaches from all categories. A narrative has been included after each table where appropriate. Recovery of these five species cannot be achieved through the actions of any one party. Implementation of the recovery approaches outlined below will require a concerted effort of many groups including, but not limited to, federal, provincial and municipal governments, conservation authorities, academic institutions, Indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations, and local citizens.
, Recommended actions to achieve these objectives are: study life history; study population structure within eastern Canadian waters; identify recovery biological reference points; study ecosystem interactions; further identify habitat, including critical habitat, as information becomes available; define measures to conserve and/or protect wolffish habitat; identify and mitigate impacts of human activity; increase resource user knowledge and raise public awareness of wolffish species through education and communication; promote stewardship initiatives; consult and cooperate with harvesters, processors, scientists, regulators, enforcement, observers, dockside monitors, governments, Indigenous groups and other ocean users; monitor wolffish spatial and temporal abundance patterns; monitor spatial and temporal patterns of natural and human induced mortality 
The Recovery Strategy and Management Plan for wolffish species in eastern Canadian waters puts forth five broad, inter-related objectives. All relate to activities that may be mitigated through human intervention.: Objective 1: enhance knowledge of the biology and life history of wolffish species, Objective 2: identify, conserve and/or protect wolffish habitat required for viable population sizes and densities, Objective 3: reduce the potential of wolffish population declines by mitigating human impacts, Objective 4: promote wolffish population growth and recovery, Objective 5: develop communication and education programs to promote the conservation and recovery of wolffish populations
, The broad strategies identified for Offshore Killer Whale listed in Table 2 are meant to: address substantiated threats to Offshore Killer Whales and their habitat; obtain credible evidence necessary to assess significance of unsubstantiated threats of concern; achieve a stable or increasing trend in abundance and genetic diversity of their population; ensure continued use of Canadian Pacific waters by Offshore Killer Whales; obtain baseline information about the population and its demographics and distribution; and address other key information needs for the purposes of recovery.
Broad strategies to recover Offshore Killer Whale:
monitor the population abundance and demographics of Offshore Killer Whales and refine knowledge of their use of Canadian Pacific waters
ensure that Offshore Killer Whales have an adequate and accessible food supply to allow recovery
ensure that disturbance from human activities does not prevent the recovery of Offshore Killer Whales
ensure that chemical and biological pollutants do not prevent the recovery of Offshore Killer Whale populations
identify critical habitat for designation and protection
The general approaches to support these broad strategies are identified in Table 2. The majority of approaches are to meet the need for foundational knowledge about the Offshore Killer Whale population. Additional approaches support the need to further understand and mitigate the identified anthropogenic and natural threats. Note that these strategies and approaches are complemented by the activities that make up the schedule of studies to identify critical habitat (Table 3).Reduce the introduction of biological pollutants, including pathogens and exotic species, into the habitats of Offshore Killer Whales and their prey, Develop and implement an ongoing long-term program to monitor population and distribution of Paxton and Vananda Stickleback Species Pairs. Conduct scientific research that contributes to recovery and/or addresses knowledge gaps affecting management of the Paxton Lake and Vananda Creek Stickleback Species Pairs. These include studies exploring basic biology and threat clarification. Investigate potential water quality implications and effects on the species pairs from the use of explosives for mining activities within the species pairs’ watersheds. Develop and implement an Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) management plan to prevent aquatic invasive species from entering and becoming established in lakes containing these species pairs. Research potential impacts of recreational lake usage on Paxton Lake and Vananda Creek Stickleback Species Pairs and develop mitigation measures to address impacts. Establish baseline parameters for turbidity, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen for all lakes and streams containing the Paxton Lake and Vananda Creek Stickleback Species Pairs to better understand the species’ biological needs and the parameters that affect habitat quality. Identify and evaluate water management options to satisfy both conservation and stakeholder needs. This may include developing and implementing projects to promote water conservation and the adoption of best practices for water use in the Paxton Lake and Vananda Creek Stickleback Species Pairs’ watersheds. Develop land management strategies, including assessing current strategies (for example, Wildlife Habitat Areas), identifying and evaluating land use planning and management options, and developing best management practices and mitigation measures for land use in the species pairs’ watersheds. Update the protocols for scientific investigations that include the collection and use of in situ studies to increase scientific understanding of Paxton Lake and Vananda Creek Stickleback Species Pairs (Rosenfeld 2008b). Develop outreach and stewardship projects in support of recovery measures and foster awareness of the Paxton Lake and Vananda Creek Stickleback Species Pairs. Target audiences should include local community members, landowners, industry, recreational groups, and local schools. Establish and support a group that undertakes stewardship initiatives that increase understanding and awareness of the Paxton Lake and Vananda Creek Stickleback Species Pairs., Management objectives: To secure long-term protection for the known populations and habitats of peacock vinyl (Obtain more precise location data and land tenure for each population and inform land managers of the species location, Determine appropriate measure to protect habitat at an ecosystem-level approach. When the species is recorded on Crown lands, initiate protection measures under existing legislation and government policy. Develop and implement a strategy for communicating with land users/stakeholders about recovery activities as required); To determine the levels of real and potential threats to this species and its habitat and to mitigate their effects (Assess and monitor the threats to determine if they are potential or real, Develop and implement a monitoring protocol that provides reliable estimates of population size and trends, and to detect human and natural threats at each known location); To confirm the distribution of peacock vinyl (including new locations) and to reliably determine population trends (Advise appropriate landowners of the potential for the species to be present on their lands and to conduct inventory for the species, in particular in Environmental Assessments for resource development, Prioritize areas for inventory and conduct inventory), Protect and restore habitat and features at phantom orchid populations, including locations where the plant is thought to be dormant. Conduct targeted inventory at suitable areas to clarify distribution of the species and prevent the inadvertent loss of not-yet discovered populations. Manage sites to maintain ecological requirements of the species and to minimize impacts on phantom orchid by addressing and mitigating key threats (e.g., habitat alteration, edge effects, invasive species, and recreation). Monitor population trends and habitat status to collect additional ecological data, including information on population numbers and recruitment. Address key knowledge gaps and gather additional ecological information to aid in species management., Broad Strategy 1: Habitat Assessment, Management, Conservation and Protection : Engage landowners and land managers in conservation or stewardship including best management practices and protection of critical habitat; Monitor and assess effectiveness of conservation agreements to protect/conserve skinks and their habitat; Prescribed burns are conducted within Spruce Woods Provincial Park at sites designated by the Prairie Management Plan, at CFB Shilo, and at various sites managed by Nature Conservancy of Canada
Broad Strategy 2: Monitoring, Assessment and Research: Conduct research to identify important microhabitat and landscape-scale characteristics, to determine genetic composition of local populations, and to determine hibernation and nesting site requirements, and the effects of grazing upon skink habitat and skink survival, and the effects of fire regimes and if invasive plant species upon skink habitat and skink survival 
Broad Strategy 3. Communication, Collaboration and Engagement: Develop a communications strategy to raise awareness of the species and its needs. The strategy should also address protection and management of the species and its habitat, targeting landowners, land managers, recreationalists, land use planners, and municipalities, Encourage landowners to report Prairie Skink observations to the Manitoba Conservation Data Centre, and to the Manitoba Herps Atlas website
, Inventory and monitoring :Implement a standardized index population and habitat-monitoring program with a specific sampling protocol (upon completion of recovery measure #5). Conduct targeted surveys of extant populations using sampling techniques proven effective at detecting Pugnose Minnow to quantify distribution and abundance of extant populations. Conduct targeted surveys within the historical range of Pugnose Minnow where the species is thought to be extirpated. Determine extent and abundance of any new populations detected. Conduct targeted surveys in non-historical areas for undetected populations in areas with suitable habitat characteristics. 
Research: Develop a standardized index population and habitat monitoring program with a specific sampling protocol. Determine the life history of the Pugnose Minnow to inform critical habitat identification and improve modelling efforts designed to determine quantifiable recovery targets. Investigate potential threats such as sources of contamination and toxic substances (for example, manure spills). Identify thresholds of tolerance to habitat modifications (for example, loss of aquatic macrophytes and riparian vegetation) to determine what constitutes destruction of critical habitat. Determine the feasibility of augmenting existing populations of Pugnose Minnow where needed, and investigate the feasibility of re-establishing Pugnose Minnow in historical habitat where appropriate.
Management and coordination : Work with municipal planning authorities so that they consider the protection of critical habitat for Pugnose Minnow within official plans. Work with relevant organizations (for example, conservation authorities, OMNRF, First Nations) to share knowledge, combine resources, implement recovery actions and ensure a coordinated approach to recovery. Promote stewardship Best Management Practices (BMPs) among landowners and First Nations abutting aquatic habitats of Pugnose Minnow, and other local landowners with potential to have direct or indirect effects on the habitat of Pugnose Minnow. Conservation authorities (Essex Region, Lower Thames Valley, Upper Thames River, and St. Clair Region) continue to play a vital role in stewardship and public education programs, which have resulted in increased awareness of species at risk and improvements to habitat and water quality throughout the range of Pugnose Minnow in Ontario. For example, the SCRCA offers grants to landowners to improve agricultural practices, tree planting and other general stewardship activities that provide direct benefits to species at risk in the Sydenham River watershed.
Stewardship and outreach : Support invasive species awareness initiatives for the public.
, The habitat is being actively managed to perpetuate tallgrass prairie through selective brush-cutting, invasive species management, and prescribed burns; long-term protection and active management of the tallgrass prairie habitat is expected to help maintain and/or potentially increase Purple Twayblade populations (AMEC 2014).
Conduct habitat assessments and regular population monitoring at extant and historical populations where suitable habitat still exists, prioritizing surveys on private properties near urban centres and populations (or sub-populations) that haven't been visited in recent years; update species and habitat mapping. Identify opportunities for improving or restoring habitat to increase abundance at extant populations and historical populations; prioritize populations (or sub-populations) for habitat management. Develop and implement standardized methods for accurate population counts and monitoring of Purple Twayblade. Determine species distribution by conducting surveys in unoccupied suitable habitat across the species' range in Canada. Enable habitat conservation by ensuring municipalities receive results of inventory and monitoring. Develop and implement habitat management and restoration methods (e.g., invasive species removal, canopy thinning, beaver and/or dam removal, prescribed burning) to maintain and/or restore suitable habitat for Purple Twayblade at extant and historical populations, as appropriate. Collaborate with land trusts, conservation organizations and public agencies to identify and secure key populations (or sub-populations), prioritizing populations at risk of being destroyed by development, for stewardship, easement or other securement techniques or conservation measures. Identify and support the implementation of best land management practices for Purple Twayblade habitat. Conduct outreach with landowners to communicate the possible impacts of land management practices (e.g., use of herbicides, fungicides and pesticides) and if available, communicate best land management practices for Purple Twayblade habitat. Determine the effectiveness of restoration techniques (e.g., prescribed fire, canopy thinning) on Purple Twayblade populations. Determine factors influencing the establishment of Purple Twayblade (e.g., dormancy, longevity of seeds in the seed bank, prolonged submersion, pollinator species), including the identity, distribution, abundance and requirements of fungal associates. Determine factors influencing the establishment of the Spring Garden Natural Area and Morgan Arboretum populations to better understand the positive attributes of the largest known populations in Canada. Establish and test a propagation protocol. Determine level of herbivory at extant populations and its effects on Purple Twayblade populations.

, Three broad strategies were identified to address threats to the species and meet the population and distribution objectives: 1) research and monitoring (Evaluate threats to habitat for all extant locations to guide local stewardship programs to improve conditions within critical habitat and other occupied habitats); 2) management and coordination (Develop an implementation plan to respond to the direct threat of Zebra Mussels on the Rainbow in the St. Clair River delta; Work with municipal planning authorities to ensure the protection of critical habitat within official plans.); and, 3) communication and outreach., Recovery approaches will: communicate the need for and the content of the recovery strategy to promote understanding and support within the province and elsewhere; monitor, assess, identify, restore and protect Athabasca Rainbow Trout populations and their habitat, and monitor human activities to assess, minimize, and mitigate ongoing and newly emerging threats; assess, align, refine, and effectively implement legislation, regulation and policy to minimize and mitigate ongoing and newly identified threats; manage the mortality of Athabasca Rainbow Trout resulting from direct and indirect human-caused sources on a sustainable basis and to establish guidelines for these activities as needed; fill knowledge gaps on Athabasca Rainbow Trout biology, ecology and environment (including interactions with introduced species) to inform prioritization and implementation of recovery actions
already complete : Recreational angling is restricted to catch-and-release only for Athabasca Rainbow Trout since 2012; Harvest of Athabasca Rainbow Trout is prohibited in all streams and rivers throughout their range since 2012 (except for Indigenous subsistence harvest and areas where Jasper National Park permits harvest of fish from ISN populations); Alberta has completely banned the use of bait to reduce hooking mortality among all species as of 2016; McKenzie Creek in the upper McLeod is closed to angling; Population inventories have been conducted throughout most of the Athabasca Rainbow Trout range; Genetic analyses have been conducted on many populations; Experimentation with raising Athabasca Rainbow Trout brood stock is ongoing; Stocking programs have been changed, where only triploid (3N) fish that have been certified disease-free are stocked, and there is no stocking in waters with outflow (note: statistically, only 97% of fish are 3N, which can still pose a risk of hybridization when millions of fish are stocked); Increased public education to reduce misidentification and increase awareness of regulations
, The recovery objectives are to: protect, maintain and improve habitat in the four rivers in Ontario where Rapids Clubtail has been found; implement a monitoring program for the locations where Rapids Clubtail is known to exist; conduct additional inventory for Rapids Clubtail in suitable habitat; and initiate research to address knowledge gaps for Rapids Clubtail
It is important to ensure adequate protection of habitat and water quality for the species' survival and recovery. The locations where the species has been found in the Credit, Thames, Humber and Mississippi Rivers should all be prescribed as habitat in a habitat regulation. At each location, the area prescribed as habitat should include the section of the river containing the rapids and the pools below the rapids, plus the wooded shores on either side extending inland to include any forest which is within 800 metres of the shoreline.
No specific recovery efforts for the Rapids Clubtail have been reported to date. However, ongoing work by conservation authorities and municipalities across the province to improve and maintain water quality/quantity will help to protect the habitat needed by this species and will be integral to any natural or assisted recovery. Such projects include water quality/quantity sampling and monitoring, shoreline protection and erosion prevention, benthos sampling and monitoring and landowner stewardship programs. Legislation to restrict cosmetic pesticide use in Ontario may also improve the situation for the Rapids Clubtail and other insects.
, Manage, restore or rehabilitate woodland habitat as appropriate using a variety of management activities such as prescribed burns, and understory/canopy thinning together with activities that increase the abundance of mature and decadent deciduous trees (e.g. tree or limb girdling) to maintain a supply of decadent deciduous trees in the future; Plant mast-producing trees in areas where declines have been documented; Promote adherence to Integrated Pest Management principles, in particular the use of insecticides with the lowest toxicity to birds and non-target insects, and avoidance of insecticide application to field edges; Limit the spread of beech bark disease (e.g. restrictions on transporting freshly cut beech firewood and firewood with cankers); Conduct research to increase the precision with which suitable habitat can be described across the species’ distribution in Canada, including research into how seasonal habitat use relates to diet in each part of its range; Refine understanding of the current and historical population abundance and distribution, as well as the extent of irreversible change, throughout the species’ Canadian range to inform a) the development of a quantitative long-term population objective and b) a quantitative baseline against which to measure changes in the species’ range; Measure nesting productivity, nesting success, fledgling survival, and survivorship throughout the year to help determine whether the decline is due to factors on Canadian breeding grounds; Assess the range-wide severity of direct (e.g. ingestion of neonicotinoid-treated seed and crops) and indirect impacts (e.g. insect prey abundance, contamination of plant material consumed) of neonicotinoid and other insecticide use in agriculture, according to time of year and habitat; Continue to develop policies and guidelines, if necessary and feasible, with respect to avoidance of incidental take of migratory birds, nests and eggs under the MBCA, such as year-round protection of Red-headed Woodpecker nesting cavities; Develop and implement additional regulations, policies and programs, if necessary and feasible, to further reduce the potential impact of insecticides on the species; Develop and implement guideline/industry standards, if necessary and feasible, to reduce the frequency of bird collisions with building windows, wind turbines, moving vehicles, transmission lines and communication towers (e.g. installation of bird deflectors and other deterrents, road signage); Engage landowners, foresters, land managers, livestock operations and First Nations with outreach materials to promote the retention of deciduous cavity trees, snags, dead limbs of trees and mast trees, in order to provide nest sites and food sources for Red-headed Woodpeckers; Raise awareness with rural landowners on the impact of predation by feral cats and ways this can be minimized; Foster cooperative relationships across all levels of government and with First Nations, landowners, foresters, farmers and researchers to fill knowledge gaps, undertake research to determine the cause of the decline of the species, and mitigate threats to the species, its prey, and their habitat (e.g., reduce incidental loss of deciduous trees with cavities); Collaborate with U.S. government agencies, researchers, and non-government organizations on population monitoring and threat assessment and mitigation research outside the breeding season (e.g. impact of beech bark disease on winter mast availability), The following short-term management objectives (over the next 5-10 years) have been established to assist in achieving the goal of the management plan: to understand the abundance and extent of existing populations; to improve our knowledge of the species’ biology, ecology, and habitat requirements; to understand long-term population and habitat trends; to improve habitat conditions; to evaluate and mitigate threats to the species and its habitat; to ensure the efficient use of resources in the management of the River Redhorse; to increase public awareness and engage private landowners, First Nations groups and the public in conservation efforts to protect the River Redhorse.
 Management priorities have been assigned to six key categories as follows: research (biology, habitat requirements, and threat evaluation); monitoring and assessment (population distribution and habitat); protection; stewardship and habitat improvement; management and coordination; outreach and communication
, Develop a sufficiently robust monitoring plan to provide a clear indication of the progress towards the management objective. 
Research may include: study life history requirements (for example, spawning behaviour and susceptibility of early life stages to water level, flow, temperature and sedimentation changes); assess occurrence of introgression with Slimy Sculpin to determine potential impacts on species; study limiting factors to population growth (for example, biotic interactions, climate change); increase understanding of causes of mortality (temperature, pollutants, predation, sedimentation, etc.). Encourage landowners, industry and relevant levels of government to consider the species in development, implementation and updating of land use plans, official community plans, by-laws and management guidelines. Promote best management practices (for example, ATV use) through increased cooperation among landowners, stewardship groups and other interested parties. Develop and distribute educational outreach materials for the general public and landowners to foster awareness of the threats to Rocky Mountain Sculpin, Westslope populations, persistence, and general biodiversity values. Outreach materials could include school programs, brochures, web-based materials, and signage to place at targeted locations.
, Increase knowledge of the species’ demography (for example, population size, distribution and trends). Develop and implement a habitat management plan taking into account all local populations of the species. Develop and implement a plan for reducing and mitigating threats to the species (for example, legal measures, best management practices) Assess the feasibility of population restoration and the associated risks Improve knowledge of the threats to the species, with a focus on the most significant threats. Improve knowledge of the ecology and population dynamics of the Rusty-patched Bumble Bee. Develop and implement a communication strategy targeting the general public, private landowners, and appropriate stakeholders. Promote and support collaboration with the United States on conservation of the species.
The feasibility assessment should include aspects such as availability of suitable habitat, climatic requirements, the availability and source of mated queens, captive rearing and release techniques, alternative recovery approaches, etc. Risk assessment should consider the benefits and the potential negative impacts related to ecological (for example, risks to source populations or ecosystems), social (for example, multiple jurisdictions), and economic aspects. 
, Develop and implement standard operating procedures and evaluate projects through impact assessment and research permitting processes to mitigate human-caused threats to the species and its habitat (i.e., human use and access, including biosecurity procedures; vehicle use; infrastructure); Mitigate stresses (e.g., erosion, vegetation changes, wind flow changes) associated with infrastructure development/ decommissioning through re-vegetation and site restoration. If mitigation is not feasible or unsuccessful, restore habitat lost or degraded because of human activity. Design and implement awareness program and information materials to provide to all visitors and researchers to increase understanding of the species, its critical habitat and best management practices to ensure its protection. Develop a standardized monitoring protocol to assess Sable Island Sweat Bee absolute or relative abundance and distribution. Monitor the species at known sites and inventory for new occurrences in priority areas. Complete taxonomic and genetic analyses for Sable Island Sweat Bee. Collaborate with academic institutions and researchers to understand the species' life cycle and social structure. Collaborate with academic institutions and researchers to understand the effects of horses and grey seals on Sable Island Sweat Bee and its habitat. (Exclosure study completed and ecological role and influence of horses and grey seals are better understood by 2025.). Collaborate with academic institutions and researchers to understand effects of invasive species and whether the Sable Island Sweat Bee has any predators and/or parasites and diseases. Collaborate with academic institutions and researchers to better understand the role of human disturbance on Sable Island Sweat Bee nesting habitat and identify potential habitat enhancement strategies. Assess feasibility and develop methodology for captive rearing Sable Island Sweat Bees and determine criteria for implementation., Monitor recovery of Salish Sucker; Fill knowledge gaps that inhibit the recovery of Salish Sucker; Ensure the integrity and proper function and reduce the fragmentation of riparian areas throughout watersheds; Reduce incidence of severe hypoxia in instream critical habitat; Protect existing habitat, restore lost or degraded habitat and create new habitat; Reduce sediment entry to instream habitats; Establish and maintain adequate water depth in all habitats with high potential productivity; Minimize entry of harmful substances to instream habitats; Reduce fragmentation of instream habitats; Encourage stewardship amongst private landowners, local governments and the general public; Support stewardship projects to increase awareness of aquatic invasive species; Explore opportunities for coordinating population assessment and recovery efforts with interested groups in United States, The following are the recovery objectives for the next 5 years:
•	maintain or enhance habitats important for the Sharp-tailed Snake's survival and recovery at each occupied site (Invasive plant control at several sites)
1.	increase habitat connectivity within populations and where possible, between those populations that are close to each other
2.	investigate the existence of additional populations throughout the species' B.C. range, including suitable habitats outside the known range
3.	reduce gaps in our knowledge of the species' seasonal movements, dispersal, habitat requirements, demographic trends, and population ecology and clarify threats to improve protection, habitat management, and threat mitigation measures; and
4.	engage landholders and land managers in stewardship and increase public awareness of the Sharp-tailed Snake and its habitats
, Identify and implement national and regional conservation priorities using multi-species or ecosystem approaches to the conservation and management (including restoration where needed) of large tracts of grasslands, wetlands and other open habitats. Promote compliance with: environmental laws and regulations that prevent disturbance to adults, nests and eggs, for all types of activities and land tenures, using an approach similar to the one developed by Environment and Climate change Canada to prevent the incidental take of migratory birds; policies land use tools. Encourage the implementation of existing reduction policies and programs for pesticides, greenhouse gases and other pollutants, and fill the gaps related to other threats (if applicable). Reassess the NatureServe ranks to obtain a better correspondence between national and subnational ranks. Update the protocols developed in the provinces and territories on the basis of recent recommendations (e.g. Calladine et al., 2008, 2010; Keyes, 2011) in order to develop and implement a standardized national monitoring protocol. Conduct research and gather Aboriginal traditional ecological knowledge. Establish a geospatial database on land use (habitats and threats) and do regular monitoring in order to adapt conservation priorities. Develop a habitat suitability model for the Short-eared Owl or a multiple species model (e.g. grassland birds). Establish conservation priorities for the Short-eared Owl and its habitats by continuing or forming partnerships. etermine effective methods to promote conservation measures to land managers, Aboriginal peoples and other stakeholders in an effort to increase their engagement., Implement the long-term population abundance monitoring program for the three populations of Shorthead Sculpin. Increase the understanding of threats to Shorthead Sculpin. Research on threats may include: monitoring water quality parameters (for example, temperature, nutrients, contaminants), especially in areas where pollution, harmful substances and increased maximum summer water temperatures are a concern, in relation to Shorthead Sculpin distribution and abundance; examining the relationship between water use, flow regulation, hydrographic regime (that is, water level, flow, abrupt changes in discharge), and Shorthead Sculpin habitats and populations. Research should include examining the relationship between flow management in the Columbiag and Kootenay rivers and Shorthead Sculpin distribution; address information gaps on species needs (life history, behaviour and habitat) that inhibit conservation of Shorthead Sculpin.; researching life history requirements (for example, spawning behaviour and susceptibility of early life stages to water level, flow, temperature and sedimentation changes); developing an inventory of habitat types (for example, substrate, depth, flow, cover) across Shorthead Sculpin’s range and defining key habitat needs (for example, sediment embeddedness); increasing understanding of causes of mortality (for example, temperature, pollutants, predation from native and non-native species, sedimentation of incubation habitat, etc.); researching limiting factors to population growth (for example, biotic interactions, climate change).  Share information about Shorthead Sculpin and encourage land owners and relevant levels of government to consider the species in the development, implementation, and updating of land use plans, official community plans, by-laws and management guidelines. Promote best management practices (for example, riparian planting by private landowners or school groups) through increased cooperation among landowners, stewardship groups and other interested parties. Incorporate Shorthead Sculpin stewardship activities into existing programs. Stewardship groups, local governments and other interested parties could lead and participate in Shorthead Sculpin stewardship activities, including the possibility of combining Shorthead Sculpin and Columbia Sculpin stewardship. Develop and distribute educational outreach materials for the general public and landowners to foster awareness of Shorthead Sculpin and general biodiversity values. Outreach materials could include school programs, brochures, web-based materials, and signage to place at targeted locations., The recovery goal for Showy Goldenrod – Boreal population is to maintain the existing population as well as any newly discovered populations, and protect the habitat within the area of occupancy and the contiguous areas of the same habitat.  Protection and recovery objectives are to:
protect and manage the habitat at known sites in Ontario
design and implement a standardized long-term monitoring program to determine the quality of the site, health of the population and population trends
address key knowledge gaps relating to habitat requirements, demographics, breeding biology and minimum viable population size; and
examine the necessity and feasibility of increasing the viability of Showy Goldenrod – Boreal population in Ontario by introducing the plant to new sites with similar habitat, and/or establishing ex situ population(s) in cultivation, Perform threat evaluation research to inform priorities for individual populations at the watershed scale. Conduct flow-needs assessments related to flood control and low flow augmentation to determine how water level fluctuations affect all life stages of Silver Shiner. Investigate the impacts of threats to Silver Shiner, such as non-native species interactions/competition with the Silver Shiner (for example, Brown Trout), and barriers to movement. Work with municipal planning authorities to encourage the protection of critical habitat for Silver Shiner within official plans. Develop a standardized index population and habitat monitoring program with a specific sampling and training protocol (to inform recovery measure 9). Determine the life history of the Silver Shiner (for example, lifespan) to inform critical habitat identification and improve modelling efforts designed to determine quantifiable recovery targets. If necessary (should natural re-colonization fail), investigate the feasibility of artificial propagation versus wild fish transfers for Silver Shiner repatriations. Involve local residents, partners, First Nations and appropriate agencies and groups in habitat improvement and threat mitigation activities. Conduct targeted surveys for undetected populations in areas with suitable habitat. Monitor watersheds where Silver Shiner is present for invasive species of concern. Promote stewardship among landowners and First Nations abutting aquatic habitats of Silver Shiner, and other local landowners with potential to have direct or indirect effects on the habitat of Silver Shiner. Increase public awareness about potential impacts of invasive species on the ecosystem, including Silver Shiner and encourage the use of existing invasive species reporting systems. Increase awareness of local bait harvesters about Silver Shiner and educate them on distinguishing it from similar species (for example, Emerald Shiner and Rosyface Shiner). Request voluntary avoidance of occupied Silver Shiner areas, and immediate release of Silver Shiner if incidentally caught, as defined under the Ontario Fishery Regulations (OMNRF 2014). Implement local stewardship programs to improve habitat conditions and reduce threats within critical habitat and other occupied habitats. Priorities and mitigation approaches to be informed through threat evaluation research. Identify existing habitat that would benefit from specific threat mitigation or other habitat improvement activities; undertake threat mitigation and/or habitat improvements to the extent possible and monitor results., Raise awareness of Skillet Clubtail (for example, species' needs, occurrences, direct threats) with relevant government agencies, land owners and managers, agriculture and forestry industry, recreational users (boaters, shoreline users). Plan for conserving and managing the species at occupied sites. Develop and implement protocols and methods (including detailed study design) to monitor Skillet Clubtail. Conduct research on Skillet Clubtail (to address knowledge gaps especially habitat requirements of larval and adult life stages). Compile and analyse information on known threats for occupied sites; Conduct research on threats to the species and its habitats (for example, effects of sewage, run-off, agricultural and forestry effluents, invasive species, recreational activities, roads). Law Enforcement and Prosecution:  Detection and Arrest: Reduce or deter illegal behaviour through compliance promotion and enforcement of existing laws and policies that protect water resources. Assess and amend, if necessary, existing water quality standards if it is determined that standards are insufficient to ensure the survival of Skillet Clubtail, Maintaining the existing population of the Slender Bush-clover is important since this single population constitutes the entire Canadian distribution. Plants have not been seen in two of the three Windsor sub-populations (i.e., Black Oak Heritage Park and Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park sub-populations) over the last two decades, which is likely due to habitat degradation. Thus, maintaining the existing population for the foreseeable future may require on-going restoration (Jones 2013). This will include significant habitat management and restoration efforts, as well as invasive species control. Appropriate actions for each of the three sub-populations are being initiated (Jones pers. comm. 2015). Even with active, ambitious, and dedicated habitat management and restoration activities, the long-term sustainability of this small population of only 165 plants is not known. Determining the population viability over the long-term is identified as a research need within the provincial recovery strategy (Jones 2013) and the Slender Bush-clover – Ontario Government Response Statement (Part 3). In addition, Environment and Climate Change Canada recognizes the role of cultivating and maintaining specimens at off-site locations for the purpose of supporting research on the feasibility and appropriateness of introducing or reintroducing the Slender Bush-clover at sites in Ojibway Park, Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park and Black Oak Heritage Park (government-supported action #3 - Part 3). Reintroduction may play an important role in the recovery of the species where habitat is considered suitable and in improving the viability of the extant population. 
As a precaution, it would be beneficial to establish some plantings of Slender Bush-clover in locations separate from the current patch to ensure that the species is not extirpated in case of an accidental event, such as a storm. The few plants in the garden bed at the Ojibway Nature Centre could be augmented to ensure a stable garden population. Slender Bush-clover is listed on Schedule 1 of the ESA as endangered only within Olibway Park, Black Oak Heritage Park and Tallgrass Heritage Park, so the plants would not have legal protection elsewhere. Therefore, it might be advisable to establish an additional restoration population somewhere within one of these parks to ensure the plants would be protected. Relocation of the restoration sites where the species was planted in Lambton County would also be beneficial to see if any restored populations of Slender Bush-clover have survived.
, 1.To establish habitat protection for all known extant sites in B.C., with no loss or degradation of currently occupied habitat: provide BC Parks and First Nations with specific sites where the plants are found, conduct field trips to view these plants, and discuss stewardship of sites; BC Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations will endeavor to work with BC Parks and First Nations to steward and manage lands for persistence of the species; work with the International Osoyoos Lake Board of Control to ensure that species needs are met with respect to the Osoyoos Lake dam; assess and mitigate the extent of the threat of shoreline development.
2. To assess and mitigate the extent of the main threats (tourism and recreation development, dams and water management/use, invasive non-native species) to the three populations in B.C: investigate the impacts of invasive species and vegetation succession; potential lakeshore development, both commercial and recreational, must be monitored with respect to small-flowered lipocarpha occurrences and habitat.
3. To confirm the distribution of small-flowered lipocarpha in B.C. (existing and new locations), and update recovery objectives as needed: determine physical habitat attributes of known sites ; revisit known sites during low water level years to determine number of occupied sites, number of plants and area of occupancy; investigate natural hydrologic processes necessary to maintain populations.
4. To investigate the feasibility of establishing one new population in B.C. where there is suitable habitat, to compensate for the population extirpated in the province: determine feasibility of establishing one additional population; investigate seed production, seed bank germination rates and longevity, seed dispersal mechanisms, and seedling and juvenile development; identify sites suitable for restoration and establishment of one additional population; implement restoration activities and translocate plants if deemed appropriate
Canadian populations of the Small-flowered Lipocarpha represent the northern distribution limit for this species in North America; occurring in both the southern interior of BC and in northwestern Ontario. Current recovery efforts focus on maintaining the 14 known extant populations, as it is deemed unlikely that restoration and/or re-introduction at extirpated sites where shoreline developments and/or severe degradation has occurred is biologically or technically feasible. However if additional naturally-occurring populations are discovered or re-discovered, these should also be maintained., The recovery goal is to ensure that threats to populations and habitat are sufficiently managed to allow for long-term persistence and expansion of the Small-mouthed Salamander population within its Ontario range on Pelee Island.  The strategy describes protection and recovery objectives for this species in Ontario, including to:
•	protect and maintain the quality and quantity of habitat on Pelee Island where the Small-mouthed Salamander occurs
•	implement a monitoring program for salamander populations, habitats, and threats on Pelee Island including surveys of suitable habitat
•	promote and carry out research on Small-mouthed Salamander genetics, populations and threats
•	investigate existing, former, and potential Small-mouthed Salamander habitats on Pelee Island to determine if restoration, re-introduction or population interventions would be appropriate; and
•	implement education, stewardship and communication programs for private landowners, residents and visitors on Pelee Island
•	 The natural expansion of the existing population to different areas of Pelee Island may be encouraged through the stewardship and management of potential recovery habitat (not currently occupied by the salamander). Approaches to recovery will focus on working in collaboration with the municipality, provincial government and local community to monitor current populations, manage current habitat effectively, increase the amount of suitable habitat available for the species, and increase our knowledge of potential threats to the species. Engaging landowners, residents and visitors in habitat management and conservation will continue to be an important part of recovery for the Small-mouthed Salamander and its habitat in Canada. exploring the potential benefits and need for a cost effective head-starting protocol/program (e.g., reproductive monitoring, artificial incubation of eggs, and release of juveniles)
Therefore, this recovery strategy also provides direction for communication, outreach, and habitat management activities. Implementing those broad strategies adopted from the provincial Recovery Strategy for the Small-mouthed Salamander in Ontario (Part 2) will aid in the understanding and recovery of this species. continuing to implement the Ontario Invasive Species Strategic Plan to address the invasive species (e.g., Phragmites) that threaten Lake Erie Watersnake, Small-mouthed Salamander and Unisexual Ambystoma (Small-mouthed Salamander dependent population)
, Continue to promote compliance with federal and provincial laws pertaining to the Snapping Turtle and its habitat. Evaluate and, if necessary, improve federal and provincial acts pertaining to the Snapping Turtle and its habitat ; ensure that the needs of the Snapping Turtle are taken into consideration in road design and improvement projects. Promote the integration of approved best management practices into the policies and practices of responsible agencies, jurisdictions and industry. Continue to develop mitigation techniques (for example, best management practices) and encourage the implementation of such techniques by various target audiences (for example, general public, landowners, land managers, industry) in order to reduce mortality, injury and harvesting; implement and evaluate mitigation techniques in order to reduce fishing bycatch; implement and evaluate techniques aimed at controlling predator populations or limiting access to nesting habitat through direct or indirect measures (for example, waste removal, predator habitat management, fencing); reduce the use of pesticides that may adversely affect the maintenance of Snapping Turtle populations (for example, metam sodium). Preserve suitable habitats that are large enough to meet the habitat needs of local populations, through stewardship, land acquisition, management and other tools. Prevent or minimize habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation (for example, filling of wetlands, shoreline development). Evaluate needs and, if necessary, restore habitat using appropriate techniques in areas where habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation pose a threat to local Snapping Turtle populations. Develop and implement a population monitoring program using a subset representative of local populations, along with a program to monitor habitat trends.. Increase knowledge of the needs related to the species’ habitat and demography (for example, determine what constitutes a viable population size). Increase knowledge of the threats to the Snapping Turtle and its habitat in order to understand the full significance of the impacts and to document the associated severity, frequency, extent and causal certainty, The goals and objectives of this plan will be achieved through implementation of the following specific strategies: (1) conservation and management of soapweed and yucca moth populations, and management of native ungulate populations to reduce losses due to herbivory; (2) conservation and management of habitat in order to maintain the quality and quantity of habitat used by soapweed and yucca moths (The Act limits using off-highway or highway vehicles (except on roads), pollution, destroying or damaging plant/animal life, garbage disposal, etc.); (3) provision of information and educational materials to the public and stakeholders to promote the conservation of soapweed and yucca moths; (4) research to elucidate aspects of the life history of soapweed and yucca moths to better understand how to conserve these species; (5) acquisition of resources needed to implement the recovery plan; and (6) development of provincial regulations to protect soapweed and yucca moths and their habitat. It is expected that implementation of activities to conserve soapweed and yucca moths, combined with stakeholder cooperation and commitment, will allow for the long-term persistence of these two species in Alberta., 1. Increase understanding of population and distribution trends, natural variability, and any linkages to threats. 2. Clarify threats associated with water use in the West Kettle, Kettle and Granby watersheds. 3. Study the relationship between discharge and Speckled Dace productivity to help replace assumptions with direct observations. 4. Support local stewardship groups to advance Speckled Dace recovery (Riparian management actions that result in stabilizing the riverbanks and reducing sediment inputs to the rivers would also likely benefit Speckled Dace.) 5. Work towards preventing entry of aquatic invasive species into Speckled Dace range above Cascade Falls. 6. Research diet of juveniles less than 18 mm. 7. Research importance of embeddedness and relate to threats that create embeddedness. 8. Research spawning, night-time, overwintering and migratory behaviour. 9. Clarify impacts of rangeland operations, including nutrient loading., These approaches and strategies include legislative and administrative tools, reduce individual mortality, injury, and illegal collection, protection, management and restoration of habitat, improved recruitment, communication, outreach and stewardship, surveys and monitoring, and research. 
Various habitat restoration, threat mitigation, and other conservation initiatives have been undertaken in Ontario to benefit the Spiny Softshell. For example, the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority has carried out extensive recovery and stewardship work for the Spiny Softshell, including locating and protecting nests. The Ontario Turtle Trauma Centre (OTTC) in Peterborough rehabilitates wild turtles that were injured in the hopes of recovering and releasing them. Through annual nesting surveys, a total of 59 nests have been located to date, which have been protected through relocation and predation mitigation measures (e.g., fencing) (Galois et al. 2010, 2011, 2012). To increase the nesting success in Quebec, a project of artificial egg incubation, followed by the release of hatchlings, has been implemented by the Implementation Team for the Recovery of Spiny Softshell in 2009 
, To work towards achieving the population and distribution objectives, seven broad strategies for recovery have been established. The broad strategies are: Use legislative and administrative tools to conserve Spotted Turtle individuals and habitat; Reduce individual mortality, injury, and illegal collection across the range of the Spotted Turtle in Canada; Protect, manage, and restore habitat across the range of Spotted Turtle in Canada; Improve recruitment in locations where local Spotted Turtle populations are in decline or viability is deemed compromised; Conduct communication, outreach, and stewardship activities; Survey and monitor local Spotted Turtle populations, habitat, and threats; and Conduct research on population demographics, habitat characterization and use, and threats/threat mitigation to fill knowledge gaps. (Implement and evaluate techniques to control predator populations or restrain access to nesting habitats through direct and indirect measures (e.g., garbage removal, predator management, and fencing). Develop a cost effective head starting protocol/program. This would incorporate nest monitoring, artificial incubation of eggs, and release of juveniles.)
At the national scale, the Canadian Herpetological Society (CHS) is the main non-profit organization devoted to the conservation of amphibians and reptiles, including turtles, and conducts the following activities: scientific investigations, public education programs and community projects, compilation and analysis of historical data and the undertaking of projects that support conservation or habitat restoration. In addition to public outreach and conservation initiatives, the Ontario Turtle Trauma Centre (OTTC) in Peterborough, Ontario rehabilitates wild turtles that were injured in the hopes of recovering and releasing them. The centre has admitted over 800 turtles (as of 2013) (Ontario Turtle Trauma Centre 2018). 

, Recommended actions to achieve these objectives are:
study life history
study population structure within eastern Canadian waters
identify recovery biological reference points
study ecosystem interactions
further identify habitat, including critical habitat, as information becomes available
define measures to conserve and/or protect wolffish habitat
identify and mitigate impacts of human activity
increase resource user knowledge and raise public awareness of wolffish species through education and communication
promote stewardship initiatives
consult and cooperate with harvesters, processors, scientists, regulators, enforcement, observers, dockside monitors, governments, Indigenous groups and other ocean users
monitor wolffish spatial and temporal abundance patterns
monitor spatial and temporal patterns of natural and human induced mortality 
The Recovery Strategy and Management Plan for wolffish species in eastern Canadian waters puts forth five broad, inter-related objectives. All relate to activities that may be mitigated through human intervention.: Objective 1: enhance knowledge of the biology and life history of wolffish species, Objective 2: identify, conserve and/or protect wolffish habitat required for viable population sizes and densities, Objective 3: reduce the potential of wolffish population declines by mitigating human impacts, Objective 4: promote wolffish population growth and recovery, Objective 5: develop communication and education programs to promote the conservation and recovery of wolffish populations
, Broad strategy 1: stocking, inventory and monitoring (population status and monitoring, stocking). a reintroduction program has been underway since 2002; however, the species is now reproducing naturally in the St. Lawrence River. The captive rearing program is under the sole responsibility of the Quebec government. Given the technical difficulties the program has faced in achieving these objectives and the considerable evidence of successful natural reproduction, the program will be reviewed in the very near future to determine whether these efforts should continue. 
Broad strategy 2: research (research on habitat components and environmental conditions, population research). Broad strategy 3: management and coordination (fishery management, habitat management). since 2014, all fishing has been banned in some aggregation sites during the spawning period under the Quebec Fishery Regulations (1990), SOR/90-214, (e.g. the mouth of the Rivière du Sud [periodic ban] and the mouth of the Rivière-Ouelle [year-round ban]). These measures can be reassessed as needed along the St. Lawrence River, upstream from Forestville (on the north shore) and Rimouski (on the south shore), all Striped Bass caught incidentally by commercial or recreational fishers must be released, with the exception of certain specimens caught by fishers with wildlife management licences participating in the monitoring network; instead, they submit their catches to the Government of Quebec for monitoring purposes (DFO 2010). When releasing live fish, fishers must take care to cause the least harm possible (Quebec Fishery Regulations [1990], SOR/90-214, pursuant to the Fisheries Act)
 Broad strategy 4: stewardship and outreach (outreach). 

, Management planning for Threaded Vertigo is concurrent with conservation planning approaches for species with similar habitats and threats. Because of the extensive knowledge gaps for this snail, most of the recommended management activities (Table 5) involve inventory, habitat information collection, habitat mapping, and threat clarification. These activities will help prioritize areas for future surveys and habitat protection efforts. A combined approach to management also includes engaging the academic, naturalist, and stewardship community in conservation projects for the species, including inventory, natural history, and habitat assessment (ex: Promote the inclusion of Threaded Vertigo in workshops on conservation and restoration of remnant old bigleaf maple and other forest ecosystems in the range of the species.)., The following are the recovery objectives: Protect all known populations of Tweedy’s lewisia throughout the B.C. range; monitor trends in population size and distribution at all known locations; and determine if it is feasible and appropriate to augment populations.
Actions to meet objectives: Encourage land managers to steward and manage lands for the persistence of the species; Develop and implement site best management practices for mitigating threats; Design a monitoring program (every 5 years) to determine population trends; Monitor populations to assess the effects of threats; Monitor populations where best management practices have been instituted and evaluate abundance as a proxy for effectiveness (Status of populations and effectiveness of recovery actions have been assessed; Impacts of threats to the species have been determined); Determine feasibility of augmentation; Investigate propagation methodologies; If determined feasible, augmentation at extant populations. Research on feasibility has been completed
, The recovery plan has the following seven objectives:
1.	Increase the number of marmots through augmentation and, if possible, by increasing survival rates and reproductive rates in the wild
2.	Maximize opportunities for successful dispersion between colonies
3.	Maintain a large and genetically diverse captive-breeding population that can produce adequate numbers of release candidates to support population recovery
4.	Prioritize the maintenance of genetic variability in the global population until recovery goals are met
5.	Reduce knowledge gaps surrounding: (a) natural levels of variability in survival and reproductive rates in the wild; (b) factors that determine key demographic rates; and (c) the best method to monitor population size and key demographic rates long term
6.	Develop and implement a plan for reducing intensive management as metapopulations recover
7.	Develop and implement a sound strategy to ensure sufficient resources are available to support recovery efforts until recovery goals are met
Habitat management and restoration in the form of manual clearing of trees has occurred and is feasible at a small scale. In some areas on Vancouver Island, predation is reduced through regulated hunting and trapping of Grey Wolves and Cougars, as in the Nanaimo Lakes metapopulation. Since 2011, marmots living near the Mount Washington Alpine Resort have received supplemental food in the form of leaf-eater biscuits (Mazuri Exotic Animal Feed) to prevent their attraction to vegetation along the lower-elevation roadways in the spring. Supplemental food has also been provided to marmots at 1 to 9 colonies in the early spring to increase the number of pups weaned (Jackson et al. 2015; Jackson, pers. comm., 2016). Remove tree ingress at extant marmot colonies to maintain habitat and increase predator detection by marmots
, 1. to ensure habitat is protected within Crown lands and private lands
2.to assess and quantify threats for this species, develop mitigation measures, and assess the effectiveness of this mitigation
3.to clarify patterns of abundance, connectivity, and population and distribution trends across the species’ British Columbia range; and
4.to clarify the species’ distribution, particularly the knowledge gaps about how patchy their distribution is, and the extent to which the species uses upper canopy habitats in British Columbia

Ensure sufficient habitat is protectedx within private and Crown forestry lands. An effective way to accomplish this is to list the Wandering Salamander as a species at risk that requires special management attention to address the impacts of forest and range activities under the Forest and Range Practices Act. Work in collaboration with resource ministries and land managers to review existing forestry retention practices and strategies to determine whether retention is sufficient to ensure long-term availability of large logs in appropriate decay classes for breeding. This will involve predictive modeling. It may also involve better guidance or enforcement of existing regulations. Decrease threats to the species by reducing the rate of forest clearing and conversion, and road and trail construction. Tsunamis cannot be mitigated, but Habitat protection measures will help to secure the species if such stochastic events destroy nearshore populations. Raise awareness about the importance of retaining large downed wood in appropriate decay classes to provide habitat on private lands. Encourage relocation of large downed wood and stumps before any construction or habitat conversion occurs. This will involve developing and delivering educational materials to the public and to consultants who conduct environmental impact assessments. Learn more about the actual impacts of threats that are currently poorly understood for this species, especially introduced disease, invasive species, pollution, and climate change. Develop and test mitigation for these, as well as the threat of logging. This will involve research. Both extensive and intensive monitoring activities are needed. Revisit historical sites and their surroundings to determine persistence and overall trends in the species’ distribution. Monitor persistence, relative abundance, and age structure at selected occurrences across the species’ range by conducting standardized surveys (for example, artificial cover-board plots). Use occupancy modeling to account for detectability. Use genetic tools to understand connectivity among the patchily distributed subpopulations. This will result in either managing subpopulations separately or aiming to re-establish connectivity among historically interbreeding populations. Clarify the species’ distribution on the Sunshine Coast and elsewhere throughout its range by conducting standardized surveys that account for detectability (for example, occupancy modeling). Develop a habitat suitability model to guide search efforts and identify knowledge gaps. Clarify the extent of canopy habitat use by surveying the canopies of large trees, especially in very moist forests, such as on the west coast of Vancouver Island. 
, The following short-term management objectives to be considered over the next 5-10 years have been identified to assist with meeting the long-term management objective: to refine extent, abundance and population demographics of existing populations; to confirm host fish(es) in the field; to continue to monitor Wavyrayed Lampmussel habitat and the habitat of its host(s); to continue to evaluate threats impacting the Wavyrayed Lampmussel and its habitat and implement remedial actions to reduce their effects; to continue to increase public awareness of the significance of the Wavyrayed Lampmussel and its status as a Canadian species at risk
Management : Continued transfer of knowledge and enhancement of expertise in freshwater mussel identification/biology through workshops, development of mussel guides and standardization of mussel sampling and relocation techniques; Ongoing collaboration between existing ecosystem recovery programs to implement recovery actions. Limit livestock access to rivers. Establish riparian buffer zones in areas of high erosion potential by encouraging naturalization or planting of native species. Ongoing examination of the feasibility of translocations and reintroductions. 
Stewardship and Awareness: Ongoing implementation of agricultural best management practices and other habitat enhancement projects in the Ausable, Sydenham, Thames, and Grand rivers;  : Ongoing outreach conducted by various organizations in the Ausable River, Sydenham River and Thames River watersheds as well as at the Walpole Island Heritage Centre has encouraged public support and participation in stewardship activities; Presentations have been delivered by DFO staff at multiple conferences and to different naturalist groups and schools 
, 1.        Inventory and monitoring: Monitor priority areas where Weidemeyer’s Admiral populations are known to exist and where prime habitat occurs along the Milk River valley to track population trends and conduct surveys to identify its distribution
2.        Habitat management: Implement appropriate habitat protection and management for both breeding and non-breeding habitat while improving our understanding of habitat requirements (Some management practices are already in existence that help to reduce human disturbance and habitat alteration, including: a Protective Area Notation (PNT) for the Milk River Basin that prevents surface disturbance within a quarter section of the river; and prohibits upstream oil and gas activity within the river valley.)
3.        Research and management: Investigate ways to control harmful invasive pests such as Russian Olive
4.        Education and communication: Improve education and communication with government, industry, public, and landowners about habitat requirements of the Weidemeyer’s Admiral
, In order to achieve the management objective, conservation measures are organized under four broad strategies:
•	Inventory and monitoring (Using consistent monitoring guidelines, continue monitoring program throughout the known range examining population and habitat trends. Conduct genetic work to determine if the populations of unknown origin are introduced or native. Using consistent survey guidelines, continue surveying new suitable habitat and historic locations throughout the known range.).
•	Research as part of an adaptive management framework (Conduct research to develop a better understanding of the species ecology and needs. Conduct research on threat impacts (e.g. fire or fire suppression, grazing, invasive species control, changes in hydrology, threshold levels) and management practices on populations and habitat quality. Investigate effectiveness of specific landowner range/habitat plans, and adjust or adapt as needed to benefit the species. Apply research findings to amend, or develop new, range/habitat plans for each landowner with Western Blue Flag plants and encourage implementation of specific recommendations to maintain Western Blue Flag habitat.)
•	Communication, collaboration and engagement (Develop, communicate and encourage general principles for grazing management of Western Blue Flag Habitat. Provide education on management of this species and other species at risk.).
•	Habitat assessment, management and conservation (Recommend effective criteria for regulations that conserve Western Blue Flag habitat and respect private landowners and lessees rights, such as engaging landowners/land managers through conservation or stewardship agreements. Engage landowners/land managers in making various improvements that enable them to manage their land in a manner which sustains Western Blue Flag and creates opportunities for implementing conservation measures. Identify, and act upon, any government policy changes that may be necessary for long-term sustainability of Western Blue Flag.). 
, The following are the management objectives for the Painted Turtle – Intermountain–Rocky Mountain population.
•	Protect habitat across the range of the population through legal and stewardship actions (Okanagan Similkameen Stewardship Society: Wetland landowner outreach program since 1994; negotiates voluntary management agreement with landowners; habitat enhancement, including invasive plant control, installation of nesting beaches and basking log, pond construction, buffer enhancement; community stewardship initiatives, conservation group coordination activities; Okanagan Wetlands Strategy: Phase 1 designed to identify and protect or restore Okanagan wetlands; basking logs have been installed at Grohman Narrows Provincial Park and at other locations throughout British Columbia)
1.	mitigate road mortality and habitat destruction threats across the range of the population (road mortality reduction (fencing), nest site enhancement, and predator deterrent projects are ongoing. Work with willing landowners/managers to mitigate threats (e.g., fencing of riparian areas to prevent disturbance by people, pets, and livestock)
2.	complete an inventory across the range of the population, and monitor significant populations (> 50 individuals) and their responses to threats, protection, and mitigation actions
3.	address key knowledge gaps in threat impacts and effectiveness of recovery actions through research
, The following objectives are necessary to meet the recovery goal and recover the species.
1.	Reduce persecution and road mortality to a level that will not affect population viability. (ex: Clarify the scope and severity of threats from biological resource use (for example, hunting and collection for the pet trade) and develop effective mitigation techniques. Clarify potential impacts from livestock on breeding and terrestrial habitat; identify mitigation measures and implement priority actions.)
2.	Secure den (hibernation) sites and connected gestation, shedding, foraging/migration, and dispersal habitat throughout the species' known range in British Columbia.

, The following are the management objectives will guide work in the near-term for northwest waterfan:
1.        to protect known populations of northwest waterfan throughout the B.C. range (Protection can be achieved through various mechanisms including: voluntary stewardship agreements, conservation covenants, sale by willing vendors on private lands, land use designations, and protected areas: Develop and provide best management practices or site-specific management plans to applicable agencies and land managers. Develop and implement a strategy for communicating with land users/stakeholders with respect to recovery activities as required.)
2.        to target inventory of suitable habitat for additional populations of northwest waterfan
3.        to monitor trends in population size and distribution at all known populations

, This recovery plan strives to reduce threats to the viability of westslope cutthroat trout by concurrently protecting, restoring, establishing, and expanding westslope cutthroat trout populations to ensure their long-term persistence in Alberta. A number of objectives are proposed to meet the maintenance and recovery goal and address threats to the survival of the species. The recovery objectives are as follows: identify and protect critical habitat for remaining genetically pure populations; improve knowledge of population genetics, size, distribution, and trends; identify opportunities to help recover genetically pure and near-genetically pure populations of westslope cutthroat trout, partly by restoring habitat and eliminating or suppressing populations of non-native fish that are having negative impacts on westslope cutthroat trout; increase education and awareness of westslope cutthroat trout for their conservation; re-establish genetically pure populations of westslope cutthroat trout in sites within their historical range that recognizes the diversity of their life history strategies in Alberta. While the recovery team discussed a target number of populations, it was decided that too many unknowns currently exist (for example, feasibility of recovering populations in areas with non-natives and success of suppression efforts) to provide a realistic number at this time; determine the role that introduced genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout may play in the recovery effort
More details : Current angling regulations are highly restrictive, and would appear to permit very little legal harvest of native or potentially native remnant populations, in part because of high minimum size limits in many stream populations that make them effectively catch-and-release only fisheries. Targeted removal of non-native species (complete removal or suppression) will be evaluated in systems which might have some chance of success. As stocking records are unclear or ambiguous in many instances, professional judgment will also be considered for some populations, (that is, where stocking has occurred on top of genetically pure, native populations or where a stocking location is unclear such as above or below a barrier). This may include introduced genetically pure populations both inside and outside of native range if they do not fit under Sportfishing populations but have high conservation value. In some circumstances Conservation populations may be managed through periodic stocking for the purpose of maintaining a genetic refugium, or when “genetic swamping” is being attempted to increase the purity level of the population. the upper Corral Creek watershed in Banff National Park will be the site of a pilot multi-year restoration proposed to commence in 2011 (re-establish westslope cutthroat trout in the headwater lake and stream above a natural waterfall barrier).  Reduce the potential for illegal introductions and cease stocking of native or non-native species where they can negatively impact recovery or survival of westslope cutthroat trout.
, Nature Conservancy of Canada and the Carolinian Canada Coalition have contributed to the formation of conservation agreements, conservation easements and the acquisition of lands to support the protection of habitat for the White Wood Aster, as well as various habitat restoration, monitoring, and outreach and education activities. Natural area inventories have contributed to the identification of additional local populations. Determine the reproductive status of local populations (i.e., ability to produce seed). Determine whether the propagation of individuals is recommended as an activity necessary to maintain or increase abundance in order to support the persistence of self-sustaining local populations. Monitor local populations for direct or indirect impacts from invasive plant species. Where necessary, implement best management practices for the control of invasive plant species. Monitor local populations for damage from deer browse. Where necessary implement actions to protect plants from deer browse. Support protection, stewardship and restoration of habitat containing local populations., The recovery objectives are to:
1.	protect and manage habitat to maintain extant populations in Ontario
2.	determine current distribution and abundance of Wild Hyacinth populations in Ontario through inventory and monitoring in association with other Carolinian woodland plant species at risk
3.	address knowledge gaps relating to their biology, ecology, habitat and threats
4.	determine feasibility of reintroduction, and reintroduce Wild Hyacinth populations to suitable historical sites and recovery habitat; and
5.	prepare and disseminate information on best management practices for Wild Hyacinth
It is recommended that an occupancy-based approach be used to define the area to be regulated as habitat under the ESA. Given that Wild Hyacinth does not occupy all apparently suitable habitat at the few extant Ontario sites, it is recommended that the area occupied by the plants, as well as surrounding habitat required for dispersal and population expansion, be prescribed as habitat in the regulation. The area prescribed should be delineated as the full extent of the Ecological Land Classification (ELC) ecosite polygon within which a population occurs.  A control program for the Double-crested Cormorant was initiated in 2008 with the aim of reducing impacts of the nesting colony on the site's vegetation and associate species at risk. Develop and implement best management practices for maintaining or improving Wild Hyacinth habitat by removing invasive species, maintaining semi-open forest conditions during flowering, and preventing inadvertent trampling.
, Determine if individuals of the Eastern population are still present • Clarify the current population characteristics, including the degree to which a rescue effect could contribute to the species’ recovery • Investigate habitat requirements using data from individuals of the Eastern population. Conduct a social acceptance study • Establish recovery measures that are mutually acceptable for all stakeholders. • After their completion, promptly follow up on scientific and social studies with additional research, stewardship, development guidelines, and/or other priorities as identified. • Promote recovery of the species and its habitat by incorporating knowledge from the western population to manage the landscape according to the precautionary approach and to support appropriate stewardship, funding and legal measures. Prepare an overview of the activities carried out since the publication of the National Recovery Plan for the Wolverine, Eastern Population (Fortin et al., 2005) and regularly update priorities, Broad strategy : Contain and prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis from Wood Bison local populations with diseases to disease-free local populations, cattle, and ranched bison, and evaluate current disease management options. Maintain at least 90% of the genetic diversity, as measured by allelic diversity, within the Wood Bison subspecies and local recovery populations for the next 200 years. Increase potential for connectivity among isolated local free-ranging, disease-free populations, and for population expansion (after the risk of brucellosis and tuberculosis transmission has been eliminated). Address and reduce key threats to Wood Bison and their habitat. Increase public awareness and acceptance for Wood Bison, including acknowledging and augmenting social, cultural, ecological, and economic relationships among Wood Bison and Indigenous peoples and local communities.
•        More info : A Bison Disease Technical Workshop was held in 2005 to examine the technical feasibility of eliminating bovine diseases from the Wood Buffalo National Park ecosystem (Shury et al. 2006). Studies have been completed on vaccines for Brucella abortus in both bison and cattle (Clapp et al. 2011, Treanor et al. 2010, Denisov et al. 2010, Hu et al. 2009, 2010), and studies are being planned to look at effectiveness of vaccine for tuberculosis in bison. Develop a contingency plan for disease and genetic management in the event a disease-free local population becomes infected with bovine tuberculosis and/or brucellosis Several reintroduced free-ranging local populations (Aishihik, Hay Zama, Mackenzie) currently have highly managed hunts, where quotas are determined by the province/territory for both the Indigenous and non-Indigenous hunts. Quotas are based on herd population dynamics and socioeconomic factors to manage herd expansion and increase public acceptance. Recommendations for use of fire in the management of Wood Bison have been proposed (Fort Nelson First Nation and Shifting Mosaics Consulting 2015). Manage genetic integrity by preventing free-ranging Plains Bison, domestic bison, and cattle from hybridizing with Wood Bison through controlling, eliminating and/or preventing incursion of these animals into areas with Wood Bison. ~4,363 Wood Bison in nine free-ranging, disease-free local populations plus 300 individuals in one public, captive, disease-free local population managed for conservation.
, Reduction of adult mortality, injury and illegal collection (develop a federal/provincial strategy to address illegal collection as pets and for consumption; protect Wood Turtle individuals through legislation and regulation tools). Conservation, management and restoration of habitat (determine habitat restoration needs in streams where Wood Turtle habitat is declining; conserve or manage Wood Turtle habitat through legislation, regulation, administrative and stewardship tools; Several habitat stewardship projects have been conducted by non-governmental and governmental organizations (e.g., structures to reduce access to roads, creation and restoration of nesting sites)); increase the area of parks and protected areas. Communication and outreach (develop and implement communication strategies appropriate to reduce adult mortality, reduce threats and conserve habitat). Improvement of recruitment where needed. Surveying and monitoring (improve the knowledge on local populations (e.g., abundance, suitable habitat size, threats, key habitats)). Research (refine knowledge of habitat needs; determine minimal habitat and population requirements to ensure local population viability; determine the full range of adverse effects), Habitat/site management (ex : On Pelee Island, properties have been restored through the removal of invasive species and planting of native grasses and shrubs, which is expected to benefit the Yellow-breasted Chat virens subspecies. At least 19 ha of former agricultural land has been restored; Investigate opportunities to secure and/or steward occupied, suitable and restorable habitat through mechanisms such as land acquisition by conservation organizations and stewardship agreements). Population Monitoring/Habitat Monitoring. Outreach and Communication for Stewardship. Research, The broad strategies to manage Yelloweye Rockfish in Canadian Pacific waters are as follows:
1.	fisheries and habitat management: adopt or maintain fisheries and habitat management practices that are beneficial to Yelloweye Rockfish and which ensure total fishery removals remain at sustainable levels
2.	assessment and monitoring: maintain and develop strategies to assess and monitor the status of Yelloweye Rockfish populations, and the effectiveness of established protection measures
3.	research: investigate knowledge gaps and threat uncertainties that will result in a benefit to Yelloweye Rockfish conservation and management
4.	outreach and communication: support communication and outreach activities aimed at mitigating threats and reducing mortality of Yelloweye Rockfish
In 2002, the Inshore Rockfish Conservation Strategy (Yamanaka and Logan 2010) introduced four key principles for the conservation and recovery of inshore rockfish species (Yelloweye, Quillback, China, Tiger, and Copper Rockfish), to: account for all rockfish catch; decrease fishing mortality; establish rockfish protection areas; improve stock assessment and fishery monitoring
The pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act include prohibitions against the deposit of deleterious substances into waters frequented by fish. Proposed amendments made in 2018 to the Fisheries Act include fisheries protection provisions that prohibit the destruction or harmful alteration of fish habitat. Both of these prohibitions apply to coastal and marine development activities that could occur in or near the habitats of Yelloweye Rockfish. The 100% at-sea and dockside monitoring of the commercial groundfish fishery allows for strict enforcement of licence conditions of these fisheries. Validated at-sea and dockside information is used to enforce bycatch and quota limits as well as timing and location of fishing activities.  On-the-water fisheries enforcement activities as well as DFO’s Air Surveillance Program allows Fishery Officers to check for illegal harvesting practices (for example, contravening time or area closures and species’ limits).

Some of the threats to Dolphin and Union Caribou such as climate change, pollution and contaminants are broad in scope and cannot be directly addressed by this management plan. Since these range-wide threats are caused by humankind, national and international cooperation and collaboration should be promoted to help mitigate them. The impact of these threats on Dolphin and Union Caribou should be highlighted through the appropriate regional, national and international fora.  In addressing these threats, all management partners will need to work collaboratively and can choose to work on approaches and actions that are most suitable for their particular organisation’s mandate.

Actions address the development and implementation of a program for monitoring habitat trends at prioritized sampling stations in different portions of the species’ range. Collaborative opportunities to incorporate monitoring into a multispecies program (for example, under climate change monitoring) are to be explored. Using the habitat information obtained (Action 2), develop a habitat suitability model to prioritize survey sites in unchecked potential habitat within this species’ range and habitat that may be available in the future, due to climate change, Lastly, further investigation of the threat of SFD to Gray Ratsnake within Canada, including presence of the disease within the Canadian population, possible vectors of the disease, methods of disease, and the potential of climate change to increase risk infection rates is required., Develop and initiate a prioritized research strategy to address biological knowledge gaps, clarify threats, and improve effectiveness of recovery actions in collaboration with academia. Clarify the severity of impacts from climate change and develop effective mitigation options, if needed., Research as part of an adaptive management framework: Determine long-term impacts of threats and management practices on populations and habitat quality. ( threat 11.1), Evaluate the impact of climate change on the survival and recovery of seals, Participate in initiatives aimed at reducing climate change, mercury contamination, pesticide use, and other toxic substances, Refine understanding of other non-fishery threats to Loggerhead Sea Turtles (climate change), Address information gaps that inhibit conservation of the Misty Lake Sticklebacks and their critical habitat; Increase scientific understanding of the Misty Lake Sticklebacks through additional investigation into their natural history and threats to their persistence (Information gaps concerning biology of the species and its needs: Water Pollution; Habitat Loss or Degradation; Climate Change; Disturbance or Harm). Examples of additional studies the monitoring program could include: trends in abundance of prey species; water quality ranges; land use impacts; macrophyte coverage in lake riparian habitat removal impact on shade and sedimentation; climate change impacts (flow in rivers, days of ice on lake, temperature, precipitation), Actions already completed or underway :Study knowledge gaps (Degree of risk from climate change and the associated changes in habitat and prey assemblage that may follow), 1.	Use legislative and administrative tools to conserve Northern Map Turtle individuals and habitat.: 1.3 Continue to encourage stewardship activities, including financial support through available funding programs. (threat : climate change ), Increase understanding of how climate change might affect Offshore Killer Whales, either directly or indirectly, The main threats (logging and wood harvesting; air pollution from agriculture and forestry effluents; storms and flooding) have been assessed and a plan developed to implement the mitigation of threats, Research should also identify possible, new, and emerging threats such as the effects of incidental angling, VHS, and the effects of climate change to local and regional hydrology., study limiting factors to population growth (for example, biotic interactions, climate change), As well, research on the effects of climate change on the species is required, in particular to assess the contraction of the species’ Canadian range. ; A threat reduction and mitigation plan should also be developed and implemented, taking into account the specific context of each local population. It will focus on the main threats to the Rusty-patched Bumble Bee (that is, pesticide use, pathogen transmission and spillover, climate change and severe weather events, intensive agriculture, urban and suburban development, and the road network) and will include all appropriate measures (for example, legislative, stewardship, best management practices) to reduce and mitigate these threats., Captive rearing plan and methodology is developed by 2030. Assess feasibility and develop methodology for captive rearing Sable Island Sweat Bees and determine criteria for implementation. Threats : 11.1 Habitat shifting and alteration; 11.2 Drought; 11.3 Temperature extremes; 11.4 Storms and flooding, Encourage the implementation of existing reduction policies and programs for pesticides, greenhouse gases and other pollutants, and fill the gaps related to other threats (if applicable).
Conduct research and gather Aboriginal traditional ecological knowledge on: the interactive effects of ecosystem changes (e.g. climate change) on birds associated with grasslands and northern regions as well as their habitats
, researching limiting factors to population growth (for example, biotic interactions, climate change), Carry out regular inventory, monitoring, surveying and sampling activities for populations, reproduction, water levels, habitat quality, new locations and threats including road mortality, climate change, and European Common Reed invasion. Investigate the impact of climate change on Small-mouthed Salamander populations. Work with local partners to maintain adequate water levels and quality, and hydrology that sustain the breeding sites and migratory routes for Small-mouthed Salamander and Unisexual Ambystoma (Small-mouthed Salamander dependent population). This may include buffering for the potential effects of climate change on water levels in the future and exploring opportunities to support hydrology at a watershed scale (e.g., restoring riparian habitat)., Most difficult to confront and mitigate is the potential effect of climate change on persistence of the Speckled Dace population in Canada, especially given the possibility that, for a species currently in the northernmost part of its global range, poleward translocation may actually counter potential deleterious effects associated with increased incidence of summer low flows. Careful and continuous monitoring of the scientific literature on behavioural and evolutionary responses of aquatic species under similar regime shifts could help inform recovery for the species.  Clarify threats associated with water use in the West Kettle, Kettle and Granby watersheds ( reduced flows in summer and autumn due to irrigation and other consumptive uses; changes in hydrograph, temperature, cover and stream morphology from climate change)., Develop and implement a habitat and snail monitoring project at a sample of sites (e.g., photographic record to monitor natural successional processes or tree die-back from drought) to monitor long-term habitat changes. This action would link with monitoring for the effects of climate change (e.g., more frequent drought). Compile a working list of priority research needs for Threaded Vertigo. 2. Information collection for patch size required for population viability has been initiated. (threats: 4.1, 5.3, 7.3, 8.1, 11.2)., The impact of this threat is unknown, this should be tracked in the short-term. Monitor populations to assess the effects of threats, The effects of climate change, such as the in-growth of coniferous trees in lower subalpine habitats, has been successfully mitigated to date at a small scale with the removal of trees that established in meadows; Remove tree ingress at extant marmot colonies to maintain habitat and increase predator detection by marmots. Determine the natural distance, frequency, and barriers for marmot dispersal (threats: [...], 11.1), Ameliorating the impacts of longer summer droughts may be feasible, but any mitigation actions will require design and testing (Shoo et al. 2011). Possibilities include supplementing artificial shelter (for example, pipes, cover boards) in open habitats to reduce desiccation and thermal stress, and thinning treatments in second-growth forests to accelerate the growth of large trees and late-successional forest conditions, which may be better at buffering climate extremes. Ensure sufficient habitat is protected within private and Crown forestry lands. An effective way to accomplish this is to list the Wandering Salamander as a species at risk that requires special management attention to address the impacts of forest and range activities under the Forest and Range Practices Act. Decrease threats to the species by reducing the rate of forest clearing and conversion, and road and trail construction. Tsunamis cannot be mitigated, but Habitat protection measures will help to secure the species if such stochastic events destroy nearshore populations. Raise awareness about the importance of retaining large downed wood in appropriate decay classes to provide habitat on private lands. Encourage relocation of large downed wood and stumps before any construction or habitat conversion occurs. This will involve developing and delivering educational materials to the public and to consultants who conduct environmental impact assessments (Threats: [...], 11.1, 11.2). Learn more about the actual impacts of threats that are currently poorly understood for this species, especially introduced disease, invasive species, pollution, and climate change. Develop and test mitigation for these, as well as the threat of logging. This will involve research. Because of the species’ sensitivity and relatively stable populations, monitoring plethodontid salamanders is recommended as an effective way to assess long-term forest health in the face of climate change, Conduct research on anticipated climate change effects within the Foothills Grassland Natural Region of Alberta. Populations have not been re-visited in the last seven years and it is unknown how localized threats and/or weather patterns (e.g. drought or flooding) are currently affecting population numbers and habitat quality. Additionally, data surrounding population dynamics, habitat trends/conditions, and the extent and severity of many threats is lacking. Ongoing monitoring to measure and monitor these variables to obtain data useful for establishing a quantitative management objective,, Develop and initiate a prioritized research strategy to address biological knowledge gaps, clarify threats, and to assess and improve effectiveness of recovery actions in collaboration with academia (threats: [...], 11). Continue to develop and deliver outreach materials to priority target audiences to increase understanding, support for and implementation of all recovery actions in collaboration with local stewardship groups (threats: [...], 11). Clarify the severity of impacts from climate change and develop effective mitigation options, if needed., Investigate factors that trigger epidemics due to chytrid fungus and other amphibian pathogens. Define current range/extent of the fungus and predicted effects of climate change., Addressing current and upcoming threats (for example, recreation, climate change), will help ensure that this species does not become more at risk., Conduct studies to better understand the potential threats associated with human activities including water regulation, connectivity/fragmentation, land-use practices, resource extraction, species introductions, climate change, angling and cumulative effects. Review current work on climate change specific to the range of westslope cutthroat trout and determine how recommendations from these studies can be incorporated into future recovery efforts. Classify and prioritize existing stream and lake populations according to status of threats and determine where populations can be restored, improved or re-established. Determine how threat elimination and mitigation might contribute to an increase in genetically pure populations that are sustainable and resilient. Threats: invasive species, adverse effects on habitat, consumptive use/exploitation, stocking, pollution and climate change. 

, Evaluate changes to hydrology and implications for bison habitat, particularly in the Lower Peace River, the Peace-Athabasca Delta, and the Slave River Lowlands, and determine management actions to ensure that habitat quality does not continue to decline from hydrological changes (Dams and water management/use (Threat 7.2); Climate change and severe weather (Threat 11)), Such research will be necessary in the future to understand issues such as recruitment variability and the impacts of climate change as per conservation measures identified in table 2. Develop an analysis of Yelloweye Rockfish spatial occurrence over time in order to identify areas of spatiotemporal importance to the species and/or areas with changing Yelloweye Rockfish frequency that may provide additional insight into the impacts of specific threats and assist in identifying appropriate management measures (Threats: [...], climate change, [...])."

  most likely number of locations is based on this threat, Of 22 revisited sites, the lichen was no longer extant at 17, a decline
 
 
  of c. 70% in N.S and it's no longer present in Ont., Quebec or N.B., No adjustment., Given uncertainty in severity, low-high range maintained., An overall threat impact of High predicts a population decline of 10-70% over the next 10 years, without considering the unknown impact of climate change., It is unknown what overall effect (positive or negative) that eutrophication will have on the food web. Excess Phosphorus loading could result in the lake becoming Nitrogen-limited, which could encourage the growth of blue-green algae and other inedible phytoplankton species., The committee assessed the overall impact as Medium rather than High because the majority of the Level 1 Threats overlap spatially and all are assessed individually as either Medium-Low or Medium. A Medium Overall Threat Impact implies a projected 3-30% population decline over the next 10 years, which was assessed as most plausible., The anticipated decline in the Cryptic Paw Lichen population at least a 50% population decline based on the threats acting in the next ten years, None, No adjustment: With the apparent extirpation of the Mercer Lake subpopulation, as targeted searches suggest, and ongoing ecosystem modification by introduced invasive Sitka Black-tailed deer, then Very High is realistic., Overall impact assigned as Medium-Low. This once widespread Canadian population seems to be stable and possible increasing in remnant patches, and ~half of the population is located in protected areas. Potential threats exist but are not currently impacting the population., Reduced from calculated threat impact of High-Medium to Medium because there is high uncertainty about the three greatest threats, all of which were thought to be closer to the lower end of range of the assigned severity scores. The species continues to persist across its Canadian range, including the Okanagan, but population trends have not been monitored adequately to detect local declines., The impact was reduced from “High” because a) there is much uncertainty about the population effects of the highest scoring threats (invasive plants and climate change), b) the scope for most of the other threats is at the low end of the range, and several larger subpopulations (for example, in Grasslands National Park) appear to be stable., 10-70% decline in population more plausible as most threats overlap geographically., The high range is drive largely by the uncertain threats of catastrophic forest fire and tsunamis, both with uncertain timing, but possible within the next ten years., Some threat categories are inter-related, but there are sufficiently many concerns that high seems appropriate., High range is from uncertainty. Medium to low concluded as overall impact., The silver lamprey is estimated to be found at 48 locations because each of the threats below is considered to act independently within each tributary stream or lake where the fish occurs., Overall, most significant threat was considered to be pollution/water quality and the most likely number of locations based on this threat, The most likely timescale for threats to act significantly on the Carrigan Lake subpopulation (95% of Canadian total) would be more than 10 years into the future, although development impacts at Carrigan Lake are possible within the next decade, and development impacts at Molega Lake are fairly likely (with potentially severe consequences to that small subpopulation) within the next decade., Assessed as Medium due to the long time scales climate change thru droughts and water management decsions., The overall threat impact was adjusted during the threats assessment phone call because this is a managed species with over 50% on conservation lands. Because critical habitat was identified in the federal recovery strategy for 24 quarter sections which contain Western Prairie Fringed Orchid, some of the threats may not be as high an impact in scope or severity; the province of Manitoba is working on effectively protecting these lands so that activities that would damage or destroy the critical habitat (as listed in the recovery strategy) don’t happen. In addition, because the species is listed under the provincial Endangered Species Act, this also protects individuals of the species, and the habitat on which it relies, from damage., There is considerable uncertainty and potential overlap and interaction of threats that is difficult to predict and assess and that might be best captured with a wide range rank of threat impacts., Although most threats are at medium or low levels, there are a great number of threats. Also, new research (Fernando et al. 2015) indicates this fern may be sensitive to the effects of climate change., Because the 'low' threats are closer to the low end, once rolled up, the group decided to modify to Low to better reflect the impact to the population., see below, Although the calculator suggests High, that assessment seems unrealistically inflated, given that there is considerable overlap among the categories for this species, and the observed rate of decline does not match such a high level of concern. High - Medium seems to more realistically characterize the blend of low-medium threats that were noted, while still acknowledging the potentially more severe impact of invasive species., Selected higher range of uncertainty due to cumulative effects of threats in combination with severity of natural limiting factors (habitat loss, small population, severe fluctuations)."
"58","TC_overall_comments","Generation time is estimated to be 5–8 years, so the timing for severity is 15–24 years., Generation time: 5-7 years; scores in red text were adjusted based on review comments from participants after the conference call, Generation time 5 - 7 years, NA, Decided to use 3 generation time of 15-20 years for assessing severity. Overall threats: remote area, main threats not serious but interacting together over longer term, no planned development. Agreement low overall., 4-9 yr generation time, therefore 12-27 yrs projection into future. Abundant in Bering Sea, portion of global population spawns in Yukon River downstream of Dawson City, possibly in Canada; threats in Canada but also downstream in Alaska. Stock in Yukon are distinct from other two stocks. Incidental catch from salmon. No Bering Cisco in Canadian portion of Porcupine River. Systems connected but Bering Cisco not yet found in either system. Important to note threats in Canadian range (versus US). Although a high level of uncertainty, no adjustment to the overall threats impact., Almost all population is in ON, QC and NB (roughly 59.6% in ON, 25.4% in QC, and 15.0% in NB). Abundance is concentrated away from peripheries; restricted to floodplains at northern margin and largely lost to agricultural and urban conversion along southern margin of Canadian range. Provincially rare in MB, NS, PE and NF. Situation in ON, QC and NB will drive the story. Generation time of ~60 years, can reproduce at 30, can live to 200 to 300 years. Avg age of reproducing individuals of 60 years is a reasonable estimate. Emerald Ash Borer has not yet changed this significantly within Canada but could do so in future., Driven mainly by pollution (even though recently improving slightly) and climate change
 
 
  (though with some uncertainty). Also some major unknowns (dams, water extraction,
 
 
  zebra mussels) which could have significant impacts. Overall, the threats were
 
 
  generally considered to be cumulative., This widespread but not common lichen species which appears
 
 
  to be disappearing in much of its range in Canada and the
 
 
  adjacent USA. The c, Call began with a description of species and a discussion of generation time. Decision that willows are likely longer but unknown. Decided to use 3 generation time of 15-20 years for assessing severity -- longer time for willows -- and see if that changes any values over threats during call. Proceeded with plan to structure call with one calculator in mind and make notes of species differences -- then create additional calculators, as needed. Overall threats: remote area, main threats not serious but interacting together over longer term, no planned development. Agreement low overall., Most of the damage to the species and its habitat occurred in the past i.e., loss of forests, habitat fragmentation, and cormorants. Species currently confined to two small areas in Canada., Average age of reproduction is estimated to be 5-8 years. Checked to see whether there was spatial overlap of threats that might suggest the need to adjust overall impact downward but found none. Threats assessment is based on known sites., Two threat calculator meetings were held (8/12/2014 and 8/2/2016), and results were combined, Generation time ~2 years so timeframe for severity and timing is 10 years into the future. Currently known from 5 localities: Pelee Island (3 clusters: Stone Road Alvar; Richard & Beryl Ivey Property + Winery Woods; Fish Point Prov. Nature Reserve); Wheatley PP; Grape Fern Woods; Rondeau PP. Status of historical occurrence at Leamington uncertain because privately owned and not accessible for surveys (Figure 2). Density estimates are only available from a few occurrences so could base scope on area of potential habitat within each occurrence. Report writer suggests 60% of the Canadian population is at Pelee Island; 20% Rondeau, 10% Wheatley, and 10% Grape Fern Woods., Generation length is 2-3 years, therefore the time frame for evaluating severity and timing is 10 years. The calculated overall threat impact of very high to high is consistent with the estimated rate of decline of 53% over the past ten years, and indications that the trend is continuing to worsen., The generation time for Chimney Swift is 4.5 years, therefore the time period for this threats calculator is 13.5 years. A consideration when considering scope is that there are more breeding Chimney Swifts in southern Ontario, southern Québec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia than in the Prairie provinces., As Coastrange Sculpin, Cultus Lake population, is only found in one location, any threat could affect the entire population.Smallmouth Bass, an invasive non-native fish species that is known to prey on sculpin, has recently been discovered in Cultus Lake and could spread throughout the lake within the next 10 years. The compounding problems of increasing temperatues with climate change, coupled with increasing nutrients from atmospheric sources and residential and agricultural areas, are causing eutrophication in the lake, leading to longer stratification periods, anoxic conditions and lower oxygen levels at depth. Hypoxia at depth is believed to be one of the more serious threats to the persistence of the Cultus Lake population. It is conceivable that there could be a massive rapid eutrophication of Cultus Lake within the next 10 years. The current abundance of the Cultus Lake Population is unknown. The current abundance trend is unknown: trawl surveys, where Coastrange Sculpin, Cultus Lake population were caught as bycatch, indicated a declining population; targeted minnow trap surveys indicate a more stable population. Time frame for severity and timing also 10 years, given 3 year generation time. Provincial parkland surrounding much (92%) of Cultus Lake under Provincial Parks Act sets management guidelines and restricts resource extraction., Generation time 5 years; three generations = 15 years for assessing severity, Generation time = 3 years therefore timeframe for severity and timing also is 10 years. Found in Columbia R downstream to US border from near Castlegar; Slocan and Kootenay rivers before flowing into Columbia; Kettle River below Cascade Falls; and Similkameen River (Figures 4&5). No subpopulation estimates (rough estimates in previous COSEWIC report provided but not re-used) to help score scope but do have lengths of rivers/streams as well as IAO calculations that might help. Columbia mainstem 11-16%; Kootenay/Slocan 22-26% (of which ~2.6% in Koch Creek); Bonnington <1%; Kettle 1-2%; Similkameen 60-62% (of which Tulameen 5%). Subpopulation in Columbia River and its tributaries in Canada appears stable but is not being monitored; distribution in tributaries of the Similkameen River declined since 1950s, There is sufficient genetic and morphological consistency across the three subspecies to consider Common Nighthawk as one Designatable Unit. Generation time is taken as 2-3 years, so a 10-year timeframe is appropriate to assess severity and timing of threats, as it exceeds 3 generations. The species breeds throughout southern and central Canada, and winters in South America. This assessment concentrates on the Canadian range, but considers threats on migration and on the wintering grounds where data exist and where it is known or suspected that migrants or overwintering birds are of Canadian origin. There may be confusion with southern nighthawk species when outside North America. There was an estimated 12% population decline from 2005-2015. As more than 50% of the Canadian range is in northern boreal forest, scientific information may be biased towards the southern portion of the range, as there is less information for boreal Canada., The Kispiox subpopulation, which contains most of the known individuals, is at high risk of logging in the next 2 generations., Imminent and specific threats are uncertain; few specific studies on potential threat factors (e.g., effects of Round Goby; turbidity), but potential threats are reasonable given general similarities to other fishes where studies have been undertaken, The average age of reproducing individuals is estimated to be 3-6 years. The threats assessment is based only on known sites with more individuals at Bigsby Inlet than at Mercer Lake., Habitat loss due to forestry operations and mortality from roads and building collisions are
recognized as threats for Evening Grosbeak, but all are likely to either be of small scope
or slight severity over the next decade., Population size: ca. 1,500 animals (uncorrected and negatively biased estimate); Generation Time: 25 yr, Population size: Unknown but likely at least 200-500. Whether the threats really are threats or limiting factors, impeding the recovery of the population that was historically greatly reduced by whaling, was discussed. The threats calculator process does not describe the situation well for long-lived, recovering species, such as whales. This population is increasing and will likely continue to do so, as it is recovering from past losses. However, the identified threat categories will impede the recovery if not appropriately managed. Generation time: 25 yr, Remote locations on Haida Gwaii and within ecological reserves and provincial park offer some secruity for populations. Threat of introduction of exotic aquatic species is low, but consequences would likely be severe., Generation time = 40 years, therefore the timing for this threats calculator is 100 years (maximum). Subpopulation #16 is a potentially introduced population but is considered part of the Canadian population since it falls within the natural range for this species., Generation time: 10 years, Generation time: 10 years; EOO: 2565 km²; IAO: 612 km²; Population size: 27 - 67K, Generation time 5 years, 3 generations = 15 years. Threats are unevenly distributed across the species' Canadian range, and most declines are expected to occur in the southern portion in the Okanagan, where pressures from human activities are the greatest., Generation time of 2 to 5 years was assumed, Mortality events likely preventing the establishment of Gray Fox in parts of Canada., GENERATION TIME 22.9 years (68.7 years = 3 GENERATIONS), Cuckoo Bumble Bee is primarily threatened by 1) the introduction and use of the highly successful Common Eastern Bumble Bee (B. impatiens) for pollination services in western Canada. Common Eastern Bumble Bee may out-compete native bee species for nesting habitat or forage resources, and may serve as a pathogen or disease source; 2) pathogen spillover - the use of infected commercial bumble bees (e.g., Common Eastern Bumble Bee in Canada) for greenhouse pollination is known to cause pathogen spillover into populations of wild bumble bees foraging nearby. Lab studies have shown the parasite species Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi (suspected) have devastating effect on Bombus colony-founding queens, foraging workers and entire nests; and 3) the use of Imidacloprid a neonicotinoid, which poses a particular threat to bees (compared to other pesticides) because they are harmful even at concentrations in the parts per billion (ppb) range. These pesticides are systemic and travel throughout the plant, reaching pollen and nectar and are commonly used on golf courses and agricultural lands., The Hoptree Borer has an annual life cycle. The Common Hoptree has a ten year (or longer) generation time., Generation time 6 years., Generation time 32-34; considering 96-102 yrs into the
future. Most individuals in Moose/Mattagami/Abitibi
(15000/17000 = 88%). Overall, population is apparently
stable / increasing. Some threats are overlapping and
overquantified. Overall threat impact was adjusted to reflect, Chilliwack Lake tributaries have pure Nooksack Dace (E. Taylor pers. comm., Jan 19/17). Generation time 3 years therefore timeframe for severity and timing is 10 years. Three tribs of Nooksack River + Brunette RIver, all Lower Fraser Valley; Tech Summary: ~69% Bertand Creek, 27% Brunette River (Burnaby), 3% Pepin Creek, < 1% Fishtrap Creek, on its way to extirpation. ~ 1/2 original riffle habitat in Nooksack tribs lost, most prior to 1996 (l. 378-379) [past threat]. N.B. Since the Threats Calculator call, fish in the Chilliwack Lake tributaries have been confirmed to be hybrids (Taylor pers. comm. 2018) and subsequently, excluded from the assessment. The Threats Calculator has been adjusted accordingly., The generation time for this species is taken as 5 years., This species has a very large range and many of the threats are poorly quantified. Due to high uncertainty, particularly regarding wintering ground impacts, Overall Threat Impact was assessed as medium, which is consistent with recent rates of decline. More information is needed to determine severity of several threats, most notably pollution and climate change; more information on migratory routes and better characterization of breeding ground populations would assist with more accurately quantifying scope of some threats., Generation time estimated to be 6 years. Although potential threats exist under multiple categories, they currently appear to all be negligible or with an unknown impact, consistent with the rapid growth of the population., Generation time estimated to be 4-6 years., assuming a 5-6 year generation time., Extreme drought is asignificant threat that has been observed in the past and likely to occur in the future and with the potential to impact the entire range in Canada. Livestock farming is also an important threat applying to all known site occurrences, but with variable impacts at each. This watershed has a very low density of people. Although still a modified watershed from agriculture, the intensity of use is low. Future dam building in either Canada and the United States portions of the Rock Creek watershed could have significant habitat impacts related to migration, reproductive suceess, species introductions, flow change and habitat change. We are not aware of any planned dam construction at this time. Completed by D. Watkinson, June 2011., Generation Time 11.5 years (3 gens=34.5) EOO=8,700,000 km² (1% = 87000 km²), Not a rapid colonizer, grows in stable sites. 4–8 yrs generation time is most plausible. So 12–24 yrs into future. 19 subpopulations., Generation time 3-5 years (3 generations 9 - 15 years), Generation time 1 year; assessment based on entire Canadian range to account for incomplete survey coverage and undocumented sites but using threats per known site as guidance., Based on experience with other species, the Rainbow would fall closer to the high than the very high overall threat impact. Based on where it is found in the rivers (headwater) it is further removed from the main threats (it is above the urban and agricultural impacts and invasives). As well, the eastern Ontario populations face different threats which are not as severe as those in other parts of the range., There are five major categories of threats that potentially impact the Lake Utopia sympatric pair: habitat alteration and degradation; enhancement of native predatory fishes and/or introduction of exotic species; water quality; recreational fishing; and hybridization. The threats to the Large-bodied population are considered high due to the recent percieved use of just one tributary stream for spawning (Mill Lake Stream). Additionally, spawning was not observed in this stream at all in some years. Generation time is 3 years therefore timeframe for severity and timing is 10 years. Small in shallower waters eat plankton, Large in deeper waters and eat fish & inverts. More small smelt. No long-term abundance trends but appears stable. 3 spawning streams (Mill Lake Stream, Trout Lake Stream, Spear Brook) but observed spawing in only one (Mill Lake Stream) since 2012. Large spawn before small but have shorter spawning period (5-10 d). Not SARA listed yet., There are five major categories of threats that potentially impact the Lake Utopia sympatric pair: habitat alteration and degradation; enhancement of native predatory fishes and/or introduction of exotic species; water quality; recreational fishing; and hybridization. The threats to the Small-bodied population are considered medium. Generation time is 3 years therefore timeframe for severity and timing is 10 years. Small in shallower waters eat plankton, Large in deeper waters and eat fish & inverts. More small smelt. No long-term abundance trends but appears stable. 3 (and possibly 4) spawning streams (Scout, Smelt, Unnamed brooks and possibly Mill Lake Stream).Large spawn before small and have a longer spawning period (3-4 wks)., One designatable unit based on the biology of this species., Residential/commercial development impact was rated ""high"" because these threats affect at least 10 of 17 catchments supporting RSD, i.e. those catchments in the most urbanized settings. Generation time 2-3 years, therefore, score severity and timing for 10 years; 30 ""subpopulations"" / ""locations"" (creeks and rivers), but most in Rouge (< 20%) and Humber (~80%) rivers (have pop estimates). RPA in development by DFO that should be reviewed before COSEWIC reassessment (December 2017 update - RPA not completed before assessment). There may be a DU split (December 2017 update - assessed as one DU). Population decline outcome = 50 -100% over the next 10 years. Currently Endangered under B criteria. 50% decline over the next 10 years is not unrealistic., Generation time = 4 years therefore time frame for severity & timing = 12 years into the future; Missouri River DU: no abundance estimates within range to help score scope although CPUE higher in upper reaches, 2 locations proposed (Milk and North Milk river), Generation time = 4 years therefore time frame for severity & timing = 12 years into the future; Saskatchewan – Nelson River DU (St. Mary + Lee Cr): no abundance estimates within range to help score scope although CPUE higher in upper reaches, 2 locations proposed (St. Mary River, Lee Creek)., Generation time = 4 years therefore time frame for severity & timing = 12 years into the future; Pacific DU: no abundance estimates within range to help score scope except for some no./m electrofishing and more in lower reaches, proposing 1-10 locations., Generation time 1 year; assessment based on entire Canadian range to account for possible undocumented sites but using threats at known sites as guidance. Modified from threats assessment for the Pygmy Slug (Kootenaia burkeii) carried out by a group on 4 Feb 2014 - the two species occupy similar habitats in the Kootenays, with the distribution of the Sheathed Slug confined to the southern portion of the Pygmy Slug's range. Overall Threat of Medium results from greater than 4 low impact threats., Completed by L. Bouvier and N.E. Mandrak, January 2011, completed by S. Reid, Sept. 2010, Sites are threatened by quartz mining and the potential of flash floods brought on by changes in the frequency, severity and timing of extreme weather events., Generation time = 20 years so 60 years into the future. Threats calculated are based on known subpopulations but suspect similar threats in unknown patches. So applied to all., Using five locations is probably the most accurate application of the rules, but feels somewhat misleading relative to the extremely limited biological area of occupancy. This is especially true at Molega Lake, where two landowners make two locations over 30m x 3m of shoreline., Generation time 20-30 years., Generation time: 5 (1-7) years. 4 locations - Somenos, Uplands Park, Christmas Hill and Mary Tod Island. Annual plant. Average seed age before germination is unknown. Evidence from closely related species suggests that seeds may remain dormant in soil for 10 or more years. Generation time is suggested as 5 years based on an estimate of the half-life of seeds in the seed bank., Remote locations on Haida Gwaii and some portion of range within a provincial park offer some secruity for populations. Threat of introduction of exotic aquatic species is low, but consequences would likely be severe., Average age six years; under best case scenarios, with adequate management, threats such as predation, climate change, and road mortality can potentially be mitigated. Captive-breeding to supplement the population has effectively mitigated the impacts of predation over the past 10 years and resulted in an increase in the marmot population. Modelling by Jackson et al. (2015) (1) suggests that continued captive breeding could have a similar result over the next 10 years. Some of the impacts of climate change can be mitigated (e.g., manual removal of tree ingrowth or supplemental feeding in case of drought) and may result in a net benefit to the species., Generation time 7-8 years therefore 3 gens = 21-24 yrs (for scoring severity and timing); Mesachie (< 1 km2), Bear (between) and Cowichan Lake (62 km2) (upstream to downstream) . Only considering Mesachie Lake and Cowichan Lake. Some lack of knowledge to score by range. Generation time is speculative 7-8 years (could be 5-12) - therefore precautionary = 20-25 years. Post telecon review of the threats assessmment by the SSC and John Post altered the Timing for Water Mangmement and Climate Change to Low (possibly in the long term) given that they are not likley within the 3-generation time window., Calculator was conducted for Alberta subpopulation only. The Saskatchewan records (Proulx and Proulx 2014) are unconfirmed and there is little known about threats across the distribution of those records., The greatest threat to Western Rattlesnake populations is similar to Great Bains Gopher Snake and is primarily from road traffic. Roads are prevalent throughout mugh of their range, and even populations in protected areas are vulnerable to traffic mortality. Note: The calculator is modified from that for the Great Basin Gopher Snake, and therefore many of the comments are identical., generation time 2.6yrs = 10yrs into the future for score, severity and timing. 10-70% or 3-30% population decline over the next 10 years or 3-70%? High range is from uncertainty. Medium to high (3-70%) concluded as overall threat impact., Assumptions: population estimate is about 960 adults; exact generation time is unknown, but the 3-generation time period is considered to be 10 years; EOO is 69,187 km2; IAO is 1672 km2 (418 grid cells)., Assumptions: Generation time 35 years. Assessments, particularly for i) Agriculture (annual & perennial non-timber crops), ii) Roads, and iii) Problematic native species are considered by some reviewers to be overly conservative., The effects climate change on habitat due to shrubification and snow accumulation are considered to be the greatest threat over the next 30-60 years. Mining is also considered to be a threat to Yukon Podistera, however only 20% of the Canadian populations is currently under any threat of mining based on active mining claims (July 2014)., Generation time: >12 years; Population size: 763 – 14,685 flowering individuals recorded in past 10 years (2005-2014) with extreme fluctuations; EOO is 48 km2 (200 quarter-sections); IAO ~670 ha (in 2006), Burrowing Owl is being assessed as one designatable unit. Re-established populations in British Columbia are being included in this assessment because they are considered self-sustaining. This assessment includes Burrowing Owls in the wintering (southern US & Mexico) and breeding ranges. Generation time is 3 years. The overall threat impact of very high suggests a 50-100% population decline in the next 10 years. Very high is consistent with the estimated rate of decline over the past decade of over 60%, which is likely ongoing, Maritime meadows more abundant in past; maintained in open vegetation condition by burning of areas by First Nations. Considerable urban development in historic area of occupation. Generation time 14 years (x3 = 42 years); major limiting factor = restriction to rare habitat type (maritime meadows), Dakota Skipper sites are Interlake Region Manitoba (Site 1: Lundar A; Site 2: Lundar B; Site 3: St. Laurent; Site 4: Oak Point); Oak Lake Region Manitoba (Site 5: Deleau A; Site 6: Deleau B; Site 7: Deleau C; Site 8: Deleau D; Site 9: Deleau E; Site 10: Deleau F; Site 11: Deleau G; Site 12: Belleview); Souris River Region Saskatchewan (Site 13: Glen Ewen A; Site 14: Glen Ewen B; Site 15: North Portal A; Site 16: North Portal B; Site 17: North Portal C; Site 18: Bienfait)., discussion about assessing threats to eastern portion and western portion of population range seperately since threats vary somewhat. Need to consider other threats to Monarch including nectar availability as adults migrate southward to wintering grounds. Agriculture Canada paper on corn crop outputs should provide predictor for corn spraying. some migratory bird papers could be useful to review. predation by birds doesnt seem to be a significant threat., Generation time estimated at 10 years.
 
 
 It is helpful to remember there were 109 EOs documented in 2013, some of which are very large spatially and in numbers of individuals. There were a total of >110,000 plants, of which approximately 1/3 were in two EOs. Given this, it is unlikely that that scope could ever be greater than 50%, other than by something like climate change., Generation time 5-7 years, up to 12 years., Result of 2 Low Threat Impact is same as that found in threat assessment done in December 2011., Generation time: 35 yrs; 3 generations 105 years, 4-5 yr generation time so 12-15 yrs projection into future. Could be up to 9 yrs but research is unpublished and not yet peer reviewed., NOTE: Generation time used from previous status report, no recent evidence to support. For purposes of the threats assessment, group agreed a longer generation time was more likely, therefore 10 years was used for generation time., The overall assigned threat impact was rated as ""low"" owing to the considerable uncertainty of the actual effects of most potential threats on Shortnose Sturgeon, particularly given the time frame of 3 generations (60 years)., Threats on the wintering habitat and during migration will also be considered here and specified where applicable. For the most part, unless otherwise specified, the threat refers to the breeding habitat of the species., Generation time is low; 3 years max., Generation time 3.4 years × 3 = 10 years. Possibly some cumulative interactions between invasive species, forestry, and fire suppression., 41 years old..123 years, There is not enough information to distinguish between the B (High) and C (Medium). Given the uncertainties it is likely that a 3% reduction in population is too low while 70% is too high. Therefore we assigned an overall threat impact of BC (High to Medium)"
