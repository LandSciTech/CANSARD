The goal of CANSARD is to be a home for the development version of The
Canadian Species At Risk (CAN-SAR) database , track changes overtime,
and automate the validation process. To access the production version of
the database go to the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/e4a58/)

## The Canadian Species at Risk (CAN-SAR) Database

The Canadian Species at Risk (CAN-SAR) database is an initiative led by
Dr.Â Ilona Naujokaitis-Lewis from Environment Climate Change Canada. The
aim of this database is to provide open and accessible data reflecting
information obtained from Canadian species at risk listing and recovery
planning documents. Ongoing efforts include development of a living
database that will facilitate contributions from other parties in an
effort to increase efficiencies and decrease multiple (redundant)
efforts with the broad over-arching goal of improving the conservation
of species at risk.
